## Known Issues

### Getting stuck when interacting with a terminal

*This is not a WTP-specific issue.*

Occasionally you may get stuck when attempting to access a terminal. This can be fixed by opening the console (tilde key, right above TAB on your keyboard) and typing in `tcl`. Upon closing the console (hitting tilde again), you should be able to use the terminal. Remember to open the console and type in `tcl` again to re-enable collision.

### Subtitles get stuck during first Minutemen quest

*This is not a WTP-specific issue.*

When talking to Preston and Sturges in the Museum of Freedom, the subtitles usually get stuck for a time during the conversation. This happens in vanilla too and cannot be fixed as far as I know.
