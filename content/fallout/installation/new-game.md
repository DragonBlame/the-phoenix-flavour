## Launching the game

In order to play TPF Fallout 4, you must launch **f4se_loader.exe** through Mod Organizer 2. Otherwise your mods will not work. When you open Mod Organizer 2, F4SE (renamed to **Welcome to Paradise** for your convenience) should be selected automatically in the executables drop-down and you can start the game by clicking **Run**.

## Starting a new save

- In the main menu, click **NEW** to start a your playthrough.
- Press 10 to temporarily toggle off ENB. It may look strange during the intro video and prologue.

Shortly after the character creation, you will get a prompt which is added by the mod **Start Me Up**. You will be asked whether you want to "relive the memory", giving you the option to skip the prologue. Do not select this option if you never played Fallout 4 before, you are going to miss some important things.

If you want to play the regular Fallout 4 intro (highly recommended), click "This is a memory. Let's stay here a while" and the prologue will play out as usual. Proceed to the [Mod Configuration](/fallout/installation/mod-configuration/) page after exiting the vault.

### Start Me Up

> Intro spoilers ahead.

If you do choose to skip the prologue because you have played it a hundred times already, select the second option: "This is a memory. I don't want to relive this.". After a fade-to-black, you will find yourself waking up inside the cryo pod shortly after a certain someone shot your spouse. Note that the door to the hall is **locked** until you interact with the terminal (left of the door), configure your SPECIAL stats and enter a name.
