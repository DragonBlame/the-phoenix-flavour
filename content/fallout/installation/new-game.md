  Starting a new game.

## Launching the game

In order to play TPF Fallout 4, you must launch **f4se_loader.exe** through Mod Organizer 2. Otherwise your mods will not work. When you open Mod Organizer 2, F4SE should be selected automatically in the executables drop-down and you can start the game by clicking **Run**.

## Hotkeys

Before you start a new game, I highly recommend going into the options and customising the keybinds. While they are up to personal preference, you will need to rebind **Quick Load** at least as the default (F9) conflicts with the Open ENB GUI hotkey.

- In the main menu, go to **Options** >> **Controls**.
- Change **Quick Load** to **F8**.
- Feel free to change any of the other hotkeys as well.

These are my personal keybind changes:

- Bash/Power Attack/Grenade to **Mouse 4** (thumb button)
- Run (toggle walk/run) to **Left CTRL**
- Move (automatically) to **C**
- Crouch to **ALT**

Of course you are not required to use the same keybinds as me. Keybinds can also be changed anytime.

## Starting a new save

TPF Fallout 4 does not include **Start Me Up** or another quick start mod. The vanilla opening is unchanged.

- Press F9 to temporarily toggle off ENB. It may look strange during the prologue.
- In the main menu, click **NEW** to start a your playthrough.

### Character Creation

After the opening cutscene, you will be prompted to customise your character. The mod [LooksMenu](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/12631) expands the available options as well as allows you to load and save presets. **Do not press C during the character customisation.** Doing so will crash the game.

Character presets for LooksMenu can be found in the [character presets](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/categories/58/) category on the Nexus. While you can probably install most of them, keep in mind that they might require additional mods not present in TPF Fallout 4.

> Installing character presets and any additional appearance mods counts as adding mods and will void your right to request support for any issues with TPF Fallout 4.

### The Prologue

Play through the intro as usual and continue with the **Mod Configuration** section after exiting the vault.
