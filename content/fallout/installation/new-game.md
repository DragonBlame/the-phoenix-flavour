  Starting a new game.

## Launching the game

In order to play TPF Fallout 4, you must launch **f4se_loader.exe** through Mod Organizer 2. Otherwise your mods will not work. When you open Mod Organizer 2, F4SE should be selected automatically in the executables drop-down and you can start the game by clicking **Run**.

## Hotkeys

Before you start a new game, I highly recommend going into the options and customising the keybinds. While they are up to personal preference, you will need to rebind **Quick Load** at least as the default (F9) conflicts with the Open ENB GUI hotkey.

- In the main menu, go to **Options** >> **Controls**.
- Change **Quick Load** to **F8**.
- Feel free to change any of the other hotkeys as well.

These are my personal keybind changes:

- Bash/Power Attack/Grenade to **Mouse 4** (thumb button)
- Run (toggle walk/run) to **Left CTRL**
- Move (automatically) to **C**
- Crouch to **ALT**

Of course you are not required to use the same keybinds as me. Keybinds can also be changed anytime.

## Starting a new save

- In the main menu, click **NEW** to start a your playthrough.
- Press F9 to temporarily toggle off ENB. It may look strange during the intro video and prologue.

Shortly after the character creation, you will get a prompt which is added by the mod **Start Me Up**. You will be asked whether you want to "relive the memory", giving you the option to skip the prologue. Do not select this option if you never played Fallout 4 before, you are going to miss some important things.

If you want to play the regular Fallout 4 intro (highly recommended), click "This is a memory. Let's stay here a while" and the prologue will play out as usual. You can now re-enable ENB by pressing F9. Proceed to the [Mod Configuration](https://thephoenixflavour.com/fallout/installation/mod-configuration/) page after exiting the vault.

### Start Me Up

> Intro spoilers ahead.

If you do choose to skip the prologue because you have played it a hundred times already, select the second option: "This is a memory. I don't want to relive this.". After a fade-to-black, you will find yourself waking up inside the cryo pod shortly after a certain someone shot your spouse. Note that the door to the hall is **locked** until you interact with the terminal (left of the door), configure your SPECIAL stats and enter a name.

#### **Interact with the terminal:**

#### **Open main door through the terminal:**

Play through the intro as usual and continue with the **Mod Configuration** section after exiting the vault.
