## About Legends of the Frost

**Legends of the Frost** (LOTF) is a Wabbajack list for Skyrim SE. It is the lightest list I could conceive of, designed to be as close to vanilla as possible while bringing some much needed improvements to texture sharpness, distant terrain, and certain gameplay mechanics. I created it because for all my years of playing Skyrim SE I never finished the main quest once. With any other setup, I get caught in the same loop as most people, updating, rebuilding, starting over again. With LOTF, this is supposed to be different.

- **LOTF** is a small mod list, both in scope and in size.
- **LOTF** will not receive updates requiring a new save for the forseeable future.
- **LOTF** is relatively light on performance.

### Core Mods

- All essentials including the Skyrim Script Extender, the USSEP, and SSE Display Tweaks.
- A plethora of fixes for various issues for a smoother vanilla-like experience.
- [Azurite Weathers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42731) with a custom ENB for skylighting and water effects.
- [Skyrim Realistic Overhaul](https://www.moddb.com/mods/skyrim-realistic-overhaul) as the base texture overhaul.
- [SkyUI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12604) with some additional improvements.
- [Blade and Blunt](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34549) with the vanilla damage modifier addon.
- [Audio Overhaul for Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12466) as well as higher quality vanilla music and voices.

Legends of the Frost features rebuilt terrain LOD with [SSELODGen](https://stepmodifications.org/forum/topic/13451-xlodgen-terrain-lod-beta-84-for-fnv-fo3-fo4-fo4vr-tes5-sse-tes5vr-enderal-enderalse/?ct=1629204990) as well as highly improved object LOD and hybrid tree LOD generated with [DynDOLOD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32382). All facegen for vanilla NPCs was recreated at twice the vanilla resolution with higher quality assets.

## Features

Legends of the Frost contains all of the most important baseline mods, including:

- [Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266): A ton of bug and consistency fixes of all kinds.
- [SSE Engine Fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17230): Enables achievements with mods, fixes lip sync as well as many other bugs and crashes.
- [SSE Display Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34705): Decouples physics engine and framerate. Improves performance in borderless-fullscreen.
- [Weapons Armor Clothing and Clutter Fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18994): Fixes a ton of issues and inconsistencies in gear progression and various items.

### Fixes & Tweaks

- [Mannequin Management](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38221): Should fix the extremely creepy stalking behaviour that mannequins liked to display.

### Weather & Lighting

Although the point was to stay as close to vanilla as possible in all aspects of the game, Legends of the Frost comes with an **ENB preset**. It was custom-made for the setup and was added only for a handful of features. These include skylighting (better shadows during the day), ambient occlusion, and water, which all noticably increase visual fidelity without drastically altering the style.

LOTF's weather overhaul is the brand-new [Azurite Weathers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42731), JonnyWang's farewell to the community. It was added largely because I was curious to see it in action and because it was not made with ENB in mind. It is the biggest visual change present in the setup. The mod includes [Vivid Fogs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59809) and I also added the recommended version of [Volumetric Mists](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29273) for additional cinematic effect.

### Textures & Meshes

This section was the hardest one for me to limit myself. In my personal opinion, there are two choices when starting to replace textures in Skyrim: Either stick strictly to the vanilla style using primarily upscaled textures, or going all in with hundreds of hand-made, high-quality textures. Naturally, I went with the latter for Legends of the Frost and it was clear from the beginning that [Base Coat](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46850) and [Skyrim Realistic Overhaul](https://www.moddb.com/mods/skyrim-realistic-overhaul) were going to make up the bulk of the replaced textures (and the overall filesize).

Beyond these major overhauls, I elected to add only those mods that I consider absolutely essential to fix various eye sores. This includes [Static Mesh Improvement Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/659) and [Blended Roads](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8834) as well as [Majestic Mountains](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11052). While we are using landscape textures from SRO, I added [Cathedral Snow](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18033) which is a more modern replacer that was specifically made for Skyrim SE. Water was hugely improved by [Cathedral Water Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22962) plus ENB tweaks.

All flora-related textures are covered by the aforementioned Base Coat repack which contains [Cathedral - Plants](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26104) and [Cathedral - Mushrooms](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26103) among other things. I did add [Enhanced Vanilla Trees](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11008) to the mix, using the default version simply for improved meshes and textures, and vastly improved LOD resources, but in the same general style as vanilla trees. I considered sticking with vanilla grass, but eventually opted for [Skyrim Flora Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2154) grass instead. It is close in style to vanilla (more sparse than most other grass overhauls) while looking noticably better in many places.

### Character Appearance

NPC faces (and hair) in Skyrim were never particularly appealing so I added a number of mods to freshen them up. Both males and females now have higher poly hands and feet instead of the [vanilla abominations](https://i.redd.it/0wp849fgwcv01.png). I added [Lucid Skin](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53030) for females and [Vitruvia](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9112) for males. For eyes, both meshes and textures were improved with [Skyrim Ultimate Eyemeshes Ruhmastered](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18147) and [Authentic Eyes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36063) respectively.

Thanks to [Natural Hair Colors](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46299), blonde hair will no longer have a sickly green tinge. [High Poly Vanilla Hair](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41863) and [Superior Lore-Friendly Hair](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/36510) offer further improvements. Retextures for brows as well as tintmasks (scars, warpaint, and dirt) are included in [Xenius Character Enhancements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36985). The tintmasks are largely in 2K which you will be able to see in game thanks to a modified **SKSE.ini** enabling higher resolution tintmasks.

Lastly, [Simple Children](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22789) was installed alongside the TRI files from [TK Children](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5916) for less potato-headed offspring.

**Facegen was regenerated for all NPCs.** That means not only will they have twice the vanilla resolution (512 > 1024), but all previously installed mods will apply to NPCs as well. Premade facegen for children is included with Simple Children.

### Interface & Controls

Beyond the general lighting, there is one other aspect of vanilla Skyrim that I wanted thoroughly overhauled: The console-optimised interface. [SkyUI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12604) is absolutely essentially for many reasons, but primarily because it hugely improves the various menus visually and functionally. It also works perfectly fine with a controller. Speaking of, I also added [hank's controller and gamepad fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42492) which allows you to use your keyboard while your controller is connected and fixes a number a number of annoyances. [Better MessageBox Controls](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1428) and [Better Dialogue Controls](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1429) further improve controls. [Stay At The System Page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/198329) brings back Skyrim LE behaviour where pressing ESCAPE would bring you to the Systems menu instead of the Journal.

Because the vanilla interface looks a tad oversized, I added [Smaller Vanilla Cursor](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20617) and [SkyHUD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/463) (with the Vanilla Small preset) to shrink it a little. When riding your horse you will be able to see its Stamina drain with [Horse Stamina HUD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/47076). Thanks to [Immersive HUD](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12440), you can toggle your entire HUD whenever you wish.

[A Quality World Map](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5804) greatly improves the quality and usability of the world map. The game will no longer prompt you with a message box asking if you're sure when crafting certain items or exiting crafting menus thanks to [Yes Im Sure](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/24898) and when attempting to drop quest items [Whose Quest Is It Anyway](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23581) will notify you which quest is binding the item to your inventory.

As background in the main menu you will see one of my favourite replacers: [DRELDYN's Original Main Menu Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6992). The menu was reduced to only the necessary options by [ReCleaned Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26680) and [Menu and Load Smoke Removed for ENB](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51986) removes the ugly background smoke effect. [KenMOD Time On Loading Screen](https://github.com/KenneyNL/Skyrim-Mods/tree/main/Time%20On%20Loading%20Screen) adds a tiny clock with your current system time to the loading screens.

### Gameplay & Difficulty

There are only two major gameplay overhauls included in Legends of the Frost: [Blade and Blunt - A Combat Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34549) greatly enhances combat so that resource management (specifically Stamina) becomes central to every fight. I also added the vanilla damage modifiers addon so that combat does not become significantly harder as well. Please refer to the mod page for up-to-date details on everything the mod does.

The second major overhaul is [Apothecary - An Alchemy Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52130) which fixes a large amount of annoyances and inconsistencies with the vanilla potion crafting. Among other things, it stretches the effect for various regeneration potions out over five seconds: A Restore Stamina will now restore X Stamina over 5 seconds instead of instantly. Again, check the mod page for more details.

**Perks, standing stones, and racial traits remain largely vanilla.** That means any vanilla builds will most likely work fine with LOTF. (Some smithing perks were adjusted by WACCF.)

Encounter zones were adjusted by [Arena - An Encounter Zone Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33487), meaning that some dungeons may be slightly higher level, but that the specific levels also make a great deal more sense. I highly recommend checking the mod page for a detailed explanation. With [Improved Traps](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17592) now create detection events (meaning they can alert enemies) and you have additional ways to disarm traps. Fortunately, followers will no longer trigger traps thanks to [Follower Trap Safety](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2755).

### Quests & NPCs

In order to make sure you never get radiant quests for areas that you are underleveled for, I added the [Radiant Requirements MCM](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45427) along with my profile to match encounter zone levels from Arena. Radiant quests will also no longer have a chance to be on Solstheim with [Quests Are In Skyrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18416).

The following quests are also affected by mods:

- [Silence Is Golden](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/50581): You have the option to lie to Lucan about finding the Golden Claw and keeping it instead.
- [Stones of Barenziah with Quest Markers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22395): You can now enable quest markers for the Stones of Barenziah in the SSoB MCM.
- [No Thieves Guild Grind](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4382): The amount of radiant quests required to fully upgrade the Ragged Flaggon was reduced from 125 to 12.
- [The Paarthurnax Resolution](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/43766): The Paarthurnax quest will now have a proper conclusion if you choose not to obey the Blades.

AS for NPCs, I added some general quality of life fixes. They will flee dragon and vampire attackes thanks to [Run For Your Lives](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2272) and [Tavern AI Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23107) prevents innkeepers from showing you to your room unless you specifically ask them to.

### Miscellaneous

- [Simple Player Home Improvements]
- [LeanWolf's Better-Shaped Weapons]
- [Faster Mining Plus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2656): Mining now requires only one strike per ore (instead of three).
