## Features

Legends of the Frost contains all of the most important baseline mods, including:

- [Unofficial Skyrim Special Edition Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/266): A ton of bug and consistency fixes of all kinds.
- [SSE Engine Fixes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/17230): Enables achievements with mods, fixes lip sync as well as many other bugs and crashes.
- [SSE Display Tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34705): Decouples physics engine and framerate. Improves performance in borderless-fullscreen.

### Weather & Lighting

Although the point was to stay as close to vanilla as possible in all aspects of the game, Legends of the Frost comes with an **ENB preset**. It was custom-made for the setup and was added only for a handful of features. These include skylighting (better shadows during the day), ambient occlusion, and water, which all noticably increase visual fidelity without drastically altering the style.

LOTF's weather overhaul is the brand-new [Azurite Weathers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42731), JonnyWang's farewell to the community. It was added largely because I was curious to see it in action and because it was not made with ENB in mind. It is the biggest visual change present in the setup. The mod includes [Vivid Fogs](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59809) and I also added the recommended version of [Volumetric Mists](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29273) for additional cinematic effect.

### Textures & Meshes

This section was the hardest one for me to limit myself. In my personal opinion, there are two choices when starting to replace textures in Skyrim: Either stick strictly to the vanilla style using primarily upscaled textures, or going all in with hundreds of hand-made, high-quality textures. Naturally, I went with the latter for Legends of the Frost and it was clear from the beginning that [Base Coat](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46850) and [Skyrim Realistic Overhaul](https://www.moddb.com/mods/skyrim-realistic-overhaul) were going to make up the bulk of the replaced textures (and the overall filesize).

Beyond these major overhauls, I elected to add only those mods that I consider absolutely essential to fix various eye sores. This includes [Static Mesh Improvement Mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/659) and [Blended Roads](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8834) as well as [Majestic Mountains](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11052). While we are using landscape textures from SRO, I added [Cathedral Snow](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18033) which is a more modern replacer that was specifically made for Skyrim SE. Water was hugely improved by [Cathedral Water Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22962) plus ENB tweaks.

All flora-related textures are covered by the aforementioned Base Coat repack which contains [Cathedral - Plants](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26104) and [Cathedral - Mushrooms](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26103) among other things. I did add [Enhanced Vanilla Trees](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11008) to the mix, using the default version simply for improved meshes and textures, and vastly improved LOD resources, but in the same general style as vanilla trees. I considered sticking with vanilla grass, but eventually opted for [Skyrim Flora Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/2154) grass instead. It is close in style to vanilla (more sparse than most other grass overhauls) while looking noticably better in many places.

### Character Appearance

NPC faces (and hair) in Skyrim were never particularly appealing so I added a number of mods to freshen them up. Both males and females now have higher poly hands and feet instead of the [vanilla abominations](https://i.redd.it/0wp849fgwcv01.png). I added [Lucid Skin](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53030) for females and [Vitruvia](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9112) for males. For eyes, both meshes and textures were improved with [Skyrim Ultimate Eyemeshes Ruhmastered](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18147) and [Authentic Eyes](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36063) respectively.

Thanks to [Natural Hair Colors](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46299), blonde hair will no longer have a sickly green tinge. [High Poly Vanilla Hair](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41863) and [Superior Lore-Friendly Hair](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/36510) offer further improvements. Retextures for brows as well as tintmasks (scars, warpaint, and dirt) are included in [Xenius Character Enhancements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36985). The tintmasks are largely in 2K which you will be able to see in game thanks to a modified **SKSE.ini** enabling higher resolution tintmasks.

Lastly, [Simple Children](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22789) was installed alongside the TRI files from [TK Children](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/5916) for less potato-headed offspring.

**Facegen was regenerated for all NPCs.** That means not only will they have twice the vanilla resolution (512 > 1024), but all previously installed mods will apply to NPCs as well. Premade facegen for children is included with Simple Children.
