## CC Support

If you own Creations or the full Anniversary Edition DLC, you have the option to add them to the LOTF CC profile. **Be aware that not all Creations are supported yet.** Creations will be located inside your default root folder and can be installed in Mod Organizer 2 like other mods.

To see which Creations are currently supported by LOTF, check the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vPH-HsEsVcw-ipbHl3Am0FL0jwF6JiR7Z-8zqWcKWvU/edit?usp=sharing).

- Navigate to `\Steam\steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition\Data\`.

This folder should contain all Creations you own. You can recognise the ESPs and BSAs by the `cc` prefix in their names. If there are no Creations in this folder, you may need to update SSE or verify game files in Steam.

Anniversary Edition owners need to launch the game once through Steam. The Creations will then be downloaded. This should already have been done during the initial [Installation](/lotf/installation/).

If you do not own the Anniversary Edition DLC, you may need to download the Creations separately from the Creation Club. In order to access the Creation Club through the main menu, disable the mod **ReCleaned Menu** under the **INTERFACE** separator in MO2.

## Installation

Check the list above and make sure you have all the currently supported Creations. **It is not possible to pick and choose.** You must install all supported Creations if you want to use the LOTF CC Profile.

- Move all of the Creations (plugins/archives beginning with **cc**) to `\Legends of the Frost\Tools\AE Content Picker\CC Content\`:

- Zip up the contents of the `\Legends of the Frost\Tools\AE Content Picker\` folder:

- Swap to the **Legends of the Frost - Creation Club** profile.

### Final Steps

After completing the FOMOD installer, you simply need to activate the new "mod":

- Rename the **Anniversary Edition Content Picker** "mod" to **[NoDelete] Creation Club**.

> The NoDelete is added in order to prevent Wabbajack from removing the mod when updating LOTF.

- Double-click the **CREATION CLUB** separator in Mod Organizer 2.
- Place the new **Creation Club** "mod" at the top above everything else.
- Click the checkmark to activate it.

Finally, make sure there is no warning in MO2. Missing masters would mean you did not install or activate the Creations correctly.
