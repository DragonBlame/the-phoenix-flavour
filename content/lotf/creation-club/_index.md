  Instructions for using the Creation Club profile in LOTF.

## CC Support

If you own Creations or the full Anniversary Edition DLC, you have the option to add them to the LOTF CC profile. **Be aware that not all Creations are supported yet.** Creations will be located inside your default root folder and can be installed in Mod Organizer 2 like other mods.

- Navigate to `\Steam\steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition\Data\`.

This folder should contain all Creations you own. You can recognise the ESPs and BSAs by the `cc` prefix in their names. If there are no Creations in this folder, you may need to update SSE or verify game files in Steam.

Anniversary Edition owners need to launch the game once through Steam. The Creations will then be downloaded.

If you do not own the Anniversary Edition DLC, you may need to download the Creations separately from the Creation Club. In order to access the Creation Club through the main menu, disable the mod **ReCleaned Menu** under the **INTERFACE** separator in MO2.

### Supported Creations

Please only install Creations that are currently supported by LOTF. This includes the following:

## Installation

Check the list above and make sure you have all the currently supported Creations. **It is not possible to pick and choose.** You must install all supported Creations if you want to use the LOTF CC Profile.

- Move all of the supported Creations to `\Legends of the Frost\mods\Creation Club\`.

- Open Mod Organizer 2 and press F5 to refresh the interface.
- Swap to the **LOTF - Creation Club** profile.

![Swap MO2 Profile](/Pictures/lotf/customisation/swap-mo2-profile.png)

- Double-click the **CREATION CLUB** separator near the bottom and enable the **Creation Club** "mod".

All Creations will now be installed. Their plugins are automatically sorted to ESM/ESL space and cannot be disabled or moved so manually adjusting the load order is not necessary.

Make sure there is no warning in MO2. Missing masters would mean you did not install or activate the Creations correctly.
