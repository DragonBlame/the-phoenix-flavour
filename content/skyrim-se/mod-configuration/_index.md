> **TPF does not use any alternate start mod.** That means that you have to go through the usual carriage ride and intro sequence after starting a new game from the main menu. The glitch present in 4.0 Beta 7 has since been fixed but very rarely users reported other problems with the carriage ride that could usually be fixed with a restart. If you do encounter issues with the intro quest, please report them on Discord.

## A Matter of Time

You can either:

- Configure the clock widget to your liking.
- Untick **Show** for each module in the **General** tab to hide it completely.
- If you installed my personal AMOT preset, go to **Presets** and click **Load user settings** (see screenshot).

## All Geared Up Derivative

- In the **NPC** tab, check **Enable Weapons**.

## Cathedral Weathers

- Uncheck **Configuration Spell** (redundant when you can access the MCM).

## Immersive HUD

- Change the hotkey to display the HUD if X is not convenient for you.
- I recommend turning on the **Key Press Toggles** option but that is a personal preference.
- Check **Link ALL SkyUI Widgets** which will link the clock from A Matter of Time to the iHUD toggle.

## moreHUD

In the **Enemy's Level** tab, uncheck the following options:

- Show Magicka Meter
- Show Stamina Meter

> These only clutter up the interface in my opinion. You can also disable Health numbers if you like.

## Realistic Water Two

Under **Mod Options** >> **Blacksmith Forge Water**, toggle the following options:

* Kynesgrove
* Rorikstead

## Storm Lightning

By default, the lightning storms with this mod are pretty intense. I'd suggest changing to a different preset (above "default") to tone them down a little.

- Under **Presets**, select any one on one of the options.

## Timing Is Everything

Another large MCM, and one you should configure now, at the start of the game as it affects many quests that start very early on in Vanilla. You can either leave the settings on default, tweak them, or apply my preset that we installed earlier. You can also apply my preset and *then* tweak whatever you dislike about it.

To apply the custom preset, do the following:

- Go to the **Extra Options** tab in the Timing Is Everything MCM.
- Click **Load Preset** and confirm.
- You will be asked not to leave the MCM before the process is complete. Confirm again.
- All values will be updated. Click **Okay** to close the final message box.

## Trade & Barter

- Under **Barter Rates** >> **Settings**, check the **Modify Barter Settings** box.

## Wonders of Weather

This is optional and personal preference. Rainsplashes will no longer cause crashes if you leave them enabled.

* Under **Rainsplashes**, set **Level** to **Disabled** to turn the effect off.
