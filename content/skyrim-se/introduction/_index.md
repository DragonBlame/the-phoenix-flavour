  Welcome to The Phoenix Flavour, a Vanilla-plus modding guide for Skyrim SE.
---

## Beta Note

> **The Phoenix Flavour** is currently in public beta. Update 4.0 is being tested and fixed.

I ask all users to be aware of this and to WAIT for the full release if they are unwilling to deal with potential issues and report them to us.

If you choose to install the 4.0 Beta, please: 

- report bugs, issues, and inconsistencies on [Github](https://github.com/foreverphoenix/the-phoenix-flavour/issues),
- and join our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/BpwXX5f) for any further questions and feedback.

**Old versions of TPF are unsupported and discontinued.**

## Overview

The Phoenix Flavour for Skyrim SE is a vanilla-plus modding guide, featuring over 600 mods carefully selected and patched for a coherent and stable experience. Originally released in 2017, it has gone through many iterations and continues to be updated and expanded frequently.

*The concept of "Vanilla plus" simply refers to a mod or mod setup that improves the existing game without attempting to turn it into something entirely different. It is a matter of preference and there are guides with different approaches out there for those who are tired of Skyrim's core gameplay loop.*

Overall, the guide is highly accessible for modding beginners with its countless additional notes, explanations and screenshots. The less experience you have with modding Skyrim, the more important it is that you read everything *carefully*. The guide was written with the assumption that most readers have little previous knowledge about modding and supplies the basics before going more in-depth.

Please note that installing the TPF setup by following the manual guide here on the website is time-consuming. Completion will likely take several days, depending on your internet connection and modding experience. If you are not interested in learning how to mod, it is highly recommended to install TPF with Wabbajack which requires only a fraction of the time and effort.

### Testimonials

> Your modlist represents what Skyrim should have been; much better visuals and much more satisfying gameplay and extras. Thank you for the tireless work and support you give on the discord. I thought I'd exhausted any enthusiasm for this game but you've injected new life into it.

> While I often use forks that supplement with additional content (currently Elysium), there is no question to my mind that TPF is the best V+ base: Solid, beautiful, performant.

> Thank you TPF team, I have been playing current Skyrim run about one year now, using the previous version of TPF. The guide itself taught a lot from modding and I managed to add  few mods on the top of the guide. I came from Xbox and this is my first PC modded PT. Gonna definitely use TPF also for the next run!

> Thanks y'all so much for putting TPF and this community together! I haven't really been able to play modded Skyrim for a long time, with my job+modlist troubleshooting taking up so much time. TPF(+Wabbajack) made it work, and is stable and documented enough that I've been able to add a couple more mods on top with some degree of confidence it won't ctd and burn.

### Modularity & Customisation

Up until the release of version 3.0, TPF was fully modular and split up into four modules (Core, Visuals, Gameplay, Content), from 3.0 onwards, all parts were merged together into one. The Customisation section with alternative and additional mods was removed in version 3.4 and finally with 3.6, all mods were made mandatory (where some were previously optional). This has all but eliminated the original pitch (full customisability) in favour of a more traditional approach featured in guides such as Lexy's LOTD.

The simple truth of the matter is that TPF is written and patched by two people with a limited amount of free time. Customisability has become completely unsustainable as the guide continued to grow and had to be dropped as a feature so that we can focus on the heart of the setup and its improvement.

Those experienced with modding and SSEEdit will find it very easy to customise the guide to their liking (though you should be aware that you are no longer eligible for support once you deviate from the instructions). Otherwise, there are many alternatives in the form of other guides and Wabbajack mod lists, including forks of TPF with mods adding more content.

## Wabbajack

Anyone who does not want to or is unable to invest large amounts of time into modding Skyrim SE should look into the **Wabbajack** version of The Phoenix Flavour instead of the installing it manually.

Wabbajack is an auto-installer capable of "cloning" a full mod setup including all tweaks and changes to someone else's system. It requires virtually no modding experiences and very little effort, although to automate the download process a Nexus Premium account is required.

|            | Advantages and Disadvantages of Wabbajack                    |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| <span style= "color: green"><i class="fas fa-plus-circle"></i></span> | The actual mod installation can be done within hours with zero effort. |
| <span style= "color: green"><i class="fas fa-plus-circle"></i></span> | All additional instructions will take much less time to follow and complete than a full run of the manual guide would. |
| <span style= "color: green"><i class="fas fa-plus-circle"></i></span> | Since most of the process is automated, it's unlikely that you will make mistakes that take time to track and fix. |
| <span style= "color: red"><i class="fas fa-minus-circle"></i></span> | Nexus Premium is required to automate the file downloads, otherwise you have to download each mod individually. |
| <span style= "color: red"><i class="fas fa-minus-circle"></i></span> | You will learn nothing about modding or utilising the required tools. |

## Features

Regardless of whether you build the setup manually or use the Wabbajack installer, here is what the resulting mod setup will feature:

- **A Better Skyrim:** The guide includes hundreds of mods across several dozen categories, all carefully selected to fit my vision of a lore-friendly, improved but not radically changed Skyrim. The Phoenix Flavour strives to provide a solid upgrade of the vanilla experience with modern visuals and rebalanced gameplay.
- **Custom Files and Patches:** Both the final patch as well as some patches and plugin replacers installed during the mod setup have been made specifically for the guide by Umgak and myself. They ensure compatibility as well as consistency between all included mods.
- **Performance:** The Phoenix Flavour was created for gameplay rather than screen-archery and will for most people deliver solid framerates on a 1080p monitor resolution. For higher resolutions, better hardware is required. Through INI changes, reasonable texture resolutions, a performance-friendly grass overhaul as well as a skippable ENB section and the choice to use lower settings in DynDOLOD, you can tweak your game until you reach a stable framerate.
- **Stability:** Skyrim SE itself is already very stable compared to Classic Skyrim. You may still experience the occasional freeze or crash, but they will be very rare (perhaps once every 20 to 30 hours). These happen in Vanilla and they will happen in TPF.

### Included Mods

You can find a full list of mods [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XFcvzBLykdkSxjX225S9tmqNWFFoTeNWUxBEK5YOIZQ/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=118321045324288884377).

- **Visuals:** Cathedral Weathers, Luminosity and Relighting Skyrim, Cathedral Landscapes.
- **Textures:** Noble Skyrim 2K overwritten by dozens of smaller mods (including the RUSTIC series and aMidianBorn).
- **Distant Level of Detail (LOD):** DynDOLOD is included and mandatory; 3D tree LOD is optional.
- **ENBSeries:** Using ENB is optional, there are instructions to add a preset and related mods.
- **Gameplay:** Featuring the full suite of [SimonMagus' suite of lightweight overhauls](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/67410746?tab=user+files).
- **Loot and Rarity:** Concept borrowed from Morrowloot, although much lighter and more stream-lined.
- **New Companions:** Custom-voiced companions of (arguably) the highest quality are included: Inigo and Lucien.
- **DLC-Sized Mods:** None included.
- **Body Replacer:** None included.
- **Needs and Survival Mods:** None included.

### Additional Mods

Please wait until **after** you completed the guide and tested your setup before adding more mods, otherwise you will no longer be eligible to receive support on our Discord server should you need it. We do not - and cannot - offer support for setups that are not 100% TPF. This includes **Creation Club** content.

### Our Tools

The Phoenix Flavour is built using the most advanced, feature-rich mod manager out there: **Mod Organizer 2**, a tool vastly superior to both the outdated Nexus Mod Manager as well as the newer Vortex.

In addition to MO2, we will routinely utilise the official Creation Kit as well as SSEEdit and the Cathedral Assets Optimizer in the manual guide. You will be provided with detailed instructions for all these tools (and others) in order to teach you how and when to use them correctly.

> This guide neither supports nor recommends **LOOT**. You should not use it at any point on a TPF installation.

## Alternatives

The Phoenix Flavour is far from the only modding guide for Skyrim SE. However, the term "modding guide" itself is used quite liberately in the community with many small mod lists being referred to as such. These are often written by inexperienced people and lack crucial features such as custom patches or certain essential mods.

Unequivocally recommended by us is [Lexy's Legacy of the Dragonborn](https://lexyslotd.com/). For more information on this and other guides, please check out my [brief overview over existing modding guides](/skyrim-se/guide-resources/modding-guides/) which lists recommended guides as well as some that should be avoided at all costs.

### TPF Forks

*[What is a fork in software terms?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development))*

If the vanilla-plus approach of TPF is to your liking but you find yourself missing additional content, check out [Elysium - A TPF Fork](https://github.com/TitansBane/Elysium) by TitansBane (author of Tools of Kagrenac and Reliquary of Myth) which expands the base setup with EnaiSiaion's suite of gameplay overhauls (replacing the default TPF SimonRim setup) and optional Creation Club support as well as [Legacy of the Dragonborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11802), 3DNPC, Vigilant, and more quest mods.

## Recommended Hardware

The specs below are recommended for those looking to install all visual mods with high settings as well as 3D tree LOD through DynDOLOD and a full ENB preset. There are several options within the guide that allow you to lower its performance impact so that the modded game remains playable even on weaker machines.

Modded Skyrim is highly GPU-dependent. A fast card with plenty of VRAM will considerably improve performance. Installing the game on an SSD will improve load times dramatically and prevent stutter.

- **CPU:** Processor with high single core performance (3.2GHz or more).
- **RAM:** 8-16 GB of DDR3 or DDR4 memory, running at 2400MHz or faster.
- **GPU:** A modern card with at least 4GB of VRAM (ideally 6-8GB or more).
- **Hard Drive:** At least 80GB of free space, ideally on an SSD.
- **Monitor:** With a standard (16:9) or widescreen (21:9) aspect ratio.

**Free space:** The full TPF installation is about 60GB large, excluding downloads (they can easily be saved to a different hard drive). Skyrim SE is another 13GB. Obviously you need to remember that your hard drive needs to have some free space left, around 20% for optimal performance.

**Widescreen support:** UI patches and replacers can be found in the Resources section to be installed after the main guide.

### Phoenix's Build

- **CPU:** Intel i5 7600k @4.2GHz, hybrid-cooled
- **RAM:** Corsair Vengeance 16GB DDR4-3200 Memory
- **GPU:** Gigabyte RTX 3080 Gaming OC (10GB VRAM)
- **SSD:** Samsung 850 Evo Series 256GB SSD (OS)
- **SSD:** Samsung 860 Evo Series 1TB SSD (Games)
- **Monitor:** LG 27GL850-B UltraGear 1440p @144Hz (primary)
- **Monitor:** Acer S242HL 1080p @60Hz (secondary)

### Monitor Resolution

Never underestimate the impact that high monitor resolutions have on performance and how closely they tie performance to your GPU. With my previous card, a 1070 FE, I could play @1080p with a stable 60-100 FPS and all the bells & whistles (such as ENB, DynDOLOD on high with 3D trees, etc). Setting my monitor's resolution to its native 1440p, I would lose about 20-30 FPS on average, making the game feel choppy in many places. The 3080 eliminated any performance issues on 1440p, essentially giving me the performance at 1440p that my 1070 managed at 1080p.

In summary: Hardware requirements for 2K and especially 4k are considerable and the recommended resolution for gameplay is 1080p. Note that compared to the majority of Skyrim SE guides and Wabbajack lists, TPF is heavily geared toward performance over visuals.
