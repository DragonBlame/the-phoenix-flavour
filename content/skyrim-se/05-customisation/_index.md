  Additional tweaks and mods for the main setup.

Considering the size of the main guide, there is a limit to how many additional options we can support. The Customisation section was written mostly to cover simple additions and tweaks so the amount of issues one can run into here is kept at a minimuim. First we will create a new profile to work with during this section so that the main guide installation is preserved in its original form. If you do run into issues, you can revert back to it anytime.

Of course the Customisation sections is completely optional. You are free to skip it entirely, and move on to the New Game section now.

## New Profile

- In Mod Organizer 2, open the **Profiles** window (Tools > Profiles or CTRL + P).
- The guide profile should be selected by default (**The Phoenix Flavour**).
- Click **Copy** and enter **The Phoenix Flavour - Customised** as the name.
- Close the **Profiles** window.
- Switch to the new profile in MO2 and only edit this one during the Customisation section.

> This way your original profile remains untouched and you can go back to your default TPF setup anytime.

## DynDOLOD

Some steps contain a warning to **Regenerate DynDOLOD**. Instructions on how to do that can be found in the very last section. If you followed any of the steps with that warning, regenerating DynDOLOD at the end is mandatory.

You are now free to go through the Customisation steps. Pick and choose.
