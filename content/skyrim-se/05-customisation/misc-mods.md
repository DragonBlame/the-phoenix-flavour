## Bent Pines

This mod sprinkles large, bent pines across the plains of Whiterun. They look majestic from a distance and sometimes a little weird close up. The author, Vurts, (who is also behind Skyrim Flora Overhaul) uploaded a [showcase video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF9zQKEXHbU) that you should check out before deciding to install this mod.

**You must regenerate DynDOLOD if you install this mod.**

#### [Download Instructions](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/8306?tab=files)

- **Main Files:** Bent Pines II

#### Mod and Load Order

- Place the mod below **Enhanced Landscapes - Oaks Standalone** in the mod order and activate it.
- Move the plugin below **ELOS Oaks Mixed Greens SSE.esp** in your load order and make sure it's checked.

## Winterhold Statue - Animated with Light

In late  2019 there was a remesh of the Winterhold College statue published which added features like ENB Particle Light for the orbs that it is holding. Unfortuntely the mod has been hidden for a while now. If you still have a copy of it on your hard drive (of version 1.1) and you are running ENBSeries, feel free to add it to the **ENB PARTICLE LIGHTS** section in your mod order.

If you "found" the file elsewhere on the internet, make sure it is the SE version (not LE).

## DirtCliff Remaster

This is the first and the last mod by LupusHegemonia to ever be mentioned in the guide. LH himself is an asset thief and drama queen  extraordinaire with many of his mods being cheap rip-offs and upscaled textures. With his DirtCliff remaster however he published one I liked. Quite a bit actually. Since LH was banned from the Nexus for thievery and impossibly rude behaviour, you will have to acquire the files elsewhere.

* LH’s HD DirtCliff Remaster 2K 1.5
* LH’s HD DirtCliff Remaster – Solstheim 2K 1.5
* LH’s HD DirtCliff Remaster – SMIM 2K 1.5
* [LH’s HD DirtCliff Remaster – Majestic Mountains Complementary Texture](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18790)

The final file was created by someone else and is still available on the Nexus. Check its mod page for preview pictures of the retexture.

#### Mod Order

Place all four files right below **Landscapes - Cathedral Concept** in your mod order.

## Trifle From Hiro – The Gate Solitude

This texture is quite different from the (ugly) vanilla one and the (much better) Noble Skyrim alternative. I uploaded a direct comparison slider [here](https://imgsli.com/NDI1Mg).

#### [Download Instructions](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/59235) (optional)

* **Main Files** – Trifle from Hiro the Gate Solityyud

#### Installation Instructions

This mod was not packaged correctly.

* Double-click **Gate Solitude from Hiro**.
* Right-click the **4096** (4K textures) folder and select **Set data directory**.

#### Mod Order

Place the mod below the **ARCHITECTURE** separator in the mod order (below HQ Solitude if you installed that).
