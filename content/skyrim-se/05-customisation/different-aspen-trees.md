## Variants

There are two alternatives to the vanilla yellow aspen trees:

- **Realistic Aspen Trees** adds red and orange variations to the vanilla yellow. It's packaged with Enhanced Vanilla Trees as part of the Alternative Trees optional file. Check the screenshots on the [official mod page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4423).
- **Green Aspen Trees** replaces, as the name suggests, the yellow with green leaves. There are screenshots in the [image section](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18162?tab=images) of the Enhanced Landscapes mod page.

Green Aspen Trees *requires* Realistic Aspen Trees so you have to install it either way.

## Realistic Aspen Trees

If you don't want Green Aspen Trees, skip ahead to the Aspen Leaves section.

## Aspen Leaves

If you installed [Rudy HQ - Falling Leaves and Needles](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25939) during the main guide, you will have yellow leaves that don't match the new aspen trees. I recommend the following:

- For **Realistic Aspen Trees** you can keep it installed anyway but you will only get yellow leaves, no orange or red ones. This may look strange at times and you may want to disable Falling Leaves and Needles entirely.
- For **Green Aspen Trees** there is actually a matching retexture available on the mod page. Follow the instructions below.

#### Green Aspen Leaves

- Download the following file from the [Rudy HQ - Falling Leaves and Needles](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25939?tab=files) Nexus page:
  - Rudy HQ - Falling Leaves and Needles SE - Green Leaves Texture 1K
- Place it below **Rudy HQ - Falling Leaves and Needles (ENB)** in your mod order and activate it.
