  Patches and replacers for 21:9 monitor owners.

For owners of widescreen monitors (resolutions of 2560x1080 or 3440x1440), there are compatible versions of all modded interface files that you will need to install in addition to or instead of the original ones. Place the widescreen versions or patches below the original mods in the mod order (they should not be overwritten).

Because I do not own a widescreen monitor, I can't download and test these files. You will have to figure it out yourself.

## Complete Widescreen Fix
