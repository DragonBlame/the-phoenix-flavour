## The Dilemma

The five additional town mods by Arthmoor were removed from the main guide in the 3.2 update. The primary reason for that was that the majority of the userbase felt they detracted from immersion rather than adding to it due to the fact that the NPCs only have generic dialogue. They will not interact with the player in any way, there are no location specific comments or quests. The towns may feel like props, cardboard cutout stand-ins, rather than actual settlements.

A smaller part of the userbase argued however that even as pretend-towns, they add to the world of Skyrim. Without Arthmoor's Oakwood, the hold of Falkreath has zero settlements beyond its capital. Oakwood is also conveniently close to Lakeview Manor, the Hearthfire player home overlooking Lake Ilinalta, connecting the Manor to civilisation. 

It is therefore up to the individual user to decide what is more immersion-breaking: Towns where nobody interacts with you, or no towns at all.

**Please note that you need to either install all five towns or skip them all.**
