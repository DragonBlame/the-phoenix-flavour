If you install this section, you will need to re-generate DynDOLOD later on.{{% /alert %}}

## Requirements

Enhanced Landscapes contains an optional set of textures and LOD files for improved ash trees on Solstheim. Unfortunately, **the LOD files only support 3D tree LOD**. If you have more than 4GB VRAM and some frames to spare, I highly recommend installing these textures and generating 3D tree LOD later on. Otherwise skip this step.

## Installation

- Create an empty mod in Mod Organizer 2 and name it **Enhanced Landscapes - Solstheim 3D Trees**.
- Right-click it and select **Open in Explorer**.
- Go to `Your Modding Folder\ARCHIVE\MO2 Downloads` and find the following archive:
  - Main File v1.65-18162-1-65.7z
- Open the archive and double-click the **3 - Solstheim3DTrees** file inside.
- Extract the **textures** and **meshes** folders to `Mod Organizer 2\mods\Enhanced Landscapes - Solstheim 3D Trees`.
- Close the archive and the Explorer window.
