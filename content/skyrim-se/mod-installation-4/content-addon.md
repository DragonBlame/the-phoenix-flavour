## About the Content Addon

> Please read the following carefully.

The Content Addon is **optional** and has a separate patch that is to be loaded after the guide's main conflict resolution patch. You will have to decide for yourself whether or not you wish to have additional quests and companions in your otherwise Vanilla-plus game.

You can follow this step installing only the **optional** and **conditional** mods. In that case, you will not have to download the final Content Addon patch. If you install mods from this step that are marked as **required**, you will have to install *all* of them plus the Content Addon patch.

##### [Morrowloot Ultimate - INIGO Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3058?tab=files)

*While we are not using MLU, our setup follows a similar logic and immediate access to Ebony weapons through Inigo breaks consistency. With this patch, he will no longer have 1000 Ebony Arrows, the Ebony Sword, and 20 Vigorous Healing Potions by default. Instead there is more appropriate equipment in the nearby chest. He keeps his Ebony bow (but it can no longer be taken from him).*

#### Download Instructions

* **Optional File:** MLU - Inigo-ESL

#### Additional Instructions

The plugin contains two records that are marked as Deleted. It is generally recommended not to outright delete records and flag them as Initially Disabled instead. This can be done quickly and easily with SSEEdit's -qac mode (quickautoclean).

- Clean **MLU - Inigo.esp** with SSEEdit. [Instructions here](http://thephoenixflavour.com/skyrim-se/guide-resources/basic-instructions).
