## Overwrite Files

As mentioned before, the ***Overwrite*** folder in Mod Organizer 2 catches all files generated by mods or applications that would normally land in your **root** folder. After the first launch, you will find quite a few files in your ***Overwrite*** that were generated by mods.

If you delete these, they’ll just be regenerated the next time you launch the game, but we don’t want them to clutter up the ***Overwrite*** either. The best solution is to keep these files with the mods they belong to, inside their mod folders. This way they will also be removed and regenerated when the mod is updated.

### Open in Explorer

* Right-click the ***Overwrite*** and select **Open in Explorer**.
* Navigate to `SKSE\Plugins` which may contain files for Simply Knock, Keyboard Shortcuts Fix, and Fuz Ro D’oh.
* Drag the window to the side or your second monitor.

### Keyboard Shortcuts Fix

> Skip this step if you did not install Keyboard Shortcuts Fix.

* Find **Keyboard Shortcuts Fix** in your mod order, right-click it and select **Open in Explorer**.
* Navigate to `Keyboard Shortcuts Fix\SKSE\Plugins`.
* Drag the **KeyboardShortcutsFix.log** file from the ***Overwrite*** into that folder.
* The resulting file path should be:
  * `Mod Organizer 2\mods\Keyboard Shortcuts Fix\SKSE\Plugins\KeyboardShortcutsFix.log`

### Fuz Ro D-oh

* Find **Fuz Ro D-oh** in your mod order, right-click it and select **Open in Explorer**.
* Navigate to `Fuz Ro D-oh\SKSE\Plugins`.
* Drag the **Fuz Ro D’oh.ini** file from the ***Overwrite*** into that folder.
* The resulting file path should be:
  * `Mod Organizer 2\mods\Fuz Ro D-oh\SKSE\Plugins\Fuz Ro D'oh.ini`

### Simply Knock

> Skip this step if you did not install Simply Knock.

* Find **Simply Knock** in your mod order, right-click it and select **Open in Explorer**.
* Return to the root of the ***Overwrite*** - `Mod Organizer 2\overwrite`.
* Move the entire **SKSE** folder into the **Simply Knock** mod folder.
* The resulting file path should be:
  * `Mod Organizer 2\mods\Simply Knock\SKSE\`

### Remaining Files

* Close all Explorer windows and return to Mod Organizer 2.
* Double-click the ***Overwrite*** and delete any left-over files (there probably aren't any).

## What now?

**Congratulations, you have completed The Phoenix Flavour!**

I hope you had a great time, found the instructions easy to follow, and didn’t run into any frustrating issues. Your game is now thoroughly overhauled and you learned plenty about modding in the meantime.

You will notice two additional sections following this one: In the **Customisation**, you may find many options to expand or tweak your current setup. This includes changes to improve performance so don’t be discouraged if you find your game running at less than 60FPS upon your first launch!

The final section, **New Game**, will help you get started with your next playthrough. It contains recommended changes to the Mod Configuration Menus.

**Happy modding!**
