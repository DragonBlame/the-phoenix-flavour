## Overwrite Files

As mentioned before, the ***Overwrite*** folder in Mod Organizer 2 catches all files generated by mods or applications that would normally land in your **root** folder. After the first launch, you will find some files in your ***Overwrite*** that were generated by mods.

If you delete these, they’ll just be regenerated the next time you launch the game, but we don’t want them to clutter up the ***Overwrite*** either. The best solution is to keep these files with the mods they belong to, inside their mod folders. This way they will also be removed and regenerated when the mod is updated.

### Open in Explorer

* Right-click the ***Overwrite*** and select **Open in Explorer**.
* Navigate to `SKSE\Plugins` which contains files for Keyboard Shortcuts Fix, and Fuz Ro D’oh.
* Drag the window to the side or your second monitor.

### Keyboard Shortcuts Fix

* Find **Keyboard Shortcuts Fix** in your mod order, right-click it and select **Open in Explorer**.
* Navigate to `Keyboard Shortcuts Fix\SKSE\Plugins`.
* Drag the **KeyboardShortcutsFix.log** file from the ***Overwrite*** into that folder.
* The resulting file path should be:
  * `Mod Organizer 2\mods\Keyboard Shortcuts Fix\SKSE\Plugins\KeyboardShortcutsFix.log`

### Fuz Ro D-oh

* Find **Fuz Ro D-oh** in your mod order, right-click it and select **Open in Explorer**.
* Navigate to `Fuz Ro D-oh\SKSE\Plugins`.
* Drag the **Fuz Ro D’oh.ini** file from the ***Overwrite*** into that folder.
* The resulting file path should be:
  * `Mod Organizer 2\mods\Fuz Ro D-oh\SKSE\Plugins\Fuz Ro D'oh.ini`

### Remaining Files

* Close all Explorer windows and return to Mod Organizer 2.
* Double-click the ***Overwrite*** and delete any left-over files.

## What now?
