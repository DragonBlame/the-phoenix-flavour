  New music tracks plus a merged patch.
---

Music tracks are added for certain parts of Skyrim through the **Music Type** records. They are split into multiple categories, including MUSCombat and different MUSExplore / MUSDiscover types. While mods that add additional music tracks use their own records for the new tracks, they need to add those records to the **Music Type** lists. Adding more than one music mod at a time will most likely require you to create a patch (if both mods add to the same Music Type) and forward all music tracks into the new plugin. This is as simple as using drag-and-drop.

For this section, I am including my personal favourite music overhauls plus a merged patch for them. If you are not comfortable editing the merged patch in SSEEdit, you must install all mods listed below and the patch. Alternatively you can install just one of the mods in which case the merged patch will not be necessary.
