##### Some beards look strange on Elven player characters.

This is unfortunately a known issue with the beard TRI files in Ethereal Elven Overhaul. Some of them clip into the skin. Fixed TRI files for one beard (HumanBeard25) are packaged with the guide's CRP so that beards on humans look fine but issues remain with some beards on Elven characters. I have no idea to fix this and consider the issue low priority since Elves are rarely bearded anyway.

Check [issue report #8](https://github.com/foreverphoenix/the-phoenix-flavour/issues/8) for details and pictures.

##### Dialogue subtitles get stuck on the screen longer after they played.

This is a known issue with the mod [Fuz Ro D-oh](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15109?tab=bugs) that the author is aware of. Since it rarely happens and doesn't disrupt gameplay, I will be keeping the mod in TPF for the forseeable future until we no longer need it.

Check [issue report #41](https://github.com/foreverphoenix/the-phoenix-flavour/issues/41) for details and pictures.

##### Grass looks strangely dull and flat.

Without ENB, grass will unfortunately look much worse. If you are running an ENB preset, make sure **Ambient Occlusion** is enabled to give grass some much needed depth. Be aware that Ambient Occlusion is fairly demanding and disabled in Lite presets for a reason.
