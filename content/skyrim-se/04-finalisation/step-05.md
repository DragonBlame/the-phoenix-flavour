  Installing a preset with ENB Man.

## 5.1 Preset Selection

For the purposes of this guide we will be using my personal favourite preset – **Visceral ENB**, warm and dreamy but still natural enough and quite performance-friendly. Afterwards, we will also install a second preset, **The Truth ENB**, which is among the most presets with the least impact on performance out there for everyone with less modern hardware.

You can install any other preset the same way. The **Customisation** section includes a list of other recommended presets.

## 5.2 Create a new preset

* In ENB Man, click the arrow under **Presets** and select **Blank preset**.
* Enter a name for the new preset, e.g. **Visceral ENB – for Obsidian Weathers [1.5]**.
* Click the green checkmark to confirm.

## 6.3 Import the preset

* Download [Visceral ENB](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21779?tab=files) (Visceral ENB – Obsidian Weathers and Seasons) manually.
* Navigate to `Your Modding Folder\temp`.
* Open the downloaded ENB Preset archive.
* Double-click the folder inside, then extract all files into the **temp** folder.
* Drag-and-drop all files from the **temp** folder into ENB Man.
* Remove all files inside the **temp** folder.

> Extracting the files into **temp** before importing them into ENB Man is done because importing directly from the ZIP archive can be a little buggy at times (skipping files and such).

## 6.4 The Truth ENB

**This is optional.**

You can skip this step and simply use Visceral ENB or install a different preset later on if you have decent hardware. The Truth preset is for those that struggle to maintain 60FPS. People who prefer vanilla visuals (especially colour and lighting) over stylised ENB presets may also want to use The Truth.

- Create a new preset in ENB Man for The Truth ENB.
- Download [The Truth ENB](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9162?tab=files) (the main file) from the Nexus page.
- Extract all files (enbseries folder, enbseries.ini, enblocal.ini) to `Your Modding Folder\temp`.
- Drag the files from there into the empty **Files** field in your new ENB Man profile.
- Click **No** when asked to import palettes.
- Delete all files in the **temp** folder.

## 6.5 Activate the preset

(The screenshot shows Visceral ENB but you can activate The Truth ENB instead if you installed it).

* Select the latest version of ENBSeries under **Binary** and tick the checkbox.
* Click the green checkmark at the bottom of the window to install the preset.
