  Preparations and starting a new playthrough.

## Timing

Before starting a new playthrough, there are some considerations.

Has there been a Skyrim update recently? If so, SKSE64, the mods depending on it as well as the guide may receive an update very soon, and it may be worth it to wait a week or two for everything to catch up before diving into the game.

> Also keep an eye on my blog or our Discord server in case a major update for the guide or a mod is imminent.

## MO2 Notifications

Before jumping into the game, go through one final checkup. In Mod Organizer 2, go to **View > Notifications**. If this is greyed out, you are good to go! If not there are multiple different warnings you might encounter:

- **Missing Masters:** One of your plugins is missing a master file. It is marked with an exclamation mark in your load order. This is most likely due to skipping a mod that was not optional or selecting the wrong option in a FOMOD  installer. Go back to the modâ€™s instructions in the guide and double-check everything.
- **Form 43 Plugin:** You forgot to re-save one or several plugins in the Creation Kit. Re-save them now.
- **Outdated SKSE Plugin:** Check the plugin's mod page to see if there is a new version.
- **Files in your overwrite:** This one is not particularly problematic and you can probably ignore it for the time being.

## New Profile

- In Mod Organizer 2, open the **Profiles** window (Tools > Profiles or CTRL + P).
- Select your **The Phoenix Flavour** or **The Phoenix Flavour - Customised** profile and click **Copy**.
- Enter a name for the new profile. Here are some suggestions:
  - `The Phoenix Flavour - {name of the character for the playthrough}`
  - `The Phoenix Flavour - {name of the build or playstyle for the playthrough}`
  - `The Phoenix Flavour - Playthrough 1`
- Click **OK** and select your new profile in the list. Make sure both options at the bottom are checked:
  - Use profile-specific Save Games
  - Use profile-specific Game INI Files
- Close the **Profiles** window.
- Switch to your new profile in Mod Organizer 2.

## Optional Mods

In your new profile, go through your mod order again - this is your last opportunity to disable some optional mods that you'd rather not use for your upcoming playthrough. Keep in mind that some optional mods have dependencies (like patches or replacer plugins) that would need to be disabled also. Others will be masters for DynDOLOD.esp and you would have to regenerate DynDOLOD if you were to disable them.

## ENB Shader Cache

If you installed ENBSeries, you should be decently sure that your current preset is the one you want to use in your playthrough. Of course you can still switch anytime but if you are planning on sticking with the preset for a while at least, I'd recommend turning on Shader Cache in the enblocal.ini. This will speed up the game launch process as ENB won't have to reload its shaders every time.

- Open **ENBMan**.
- Double-click the **Skyrim SE** profile.
- Disable your current preset (click the checkmark to save if you changed anything).
- Click the gears icon in the **Global Settings** section.
- Double-click **enblocal.ini**.
- Scroll down to the performance area and double-click **ShaderCache**.
- Change the value to **True** and click the green checkmark to confirm.
- Close the window and click **Yes** to save your change.
- Close out of the **Global Configuration Files** window and reactivate your preset.

## New Game

- Run **SKSE** through Mod Organizer 2.
- Select **NEW** in the Skyrim main menu to start your playthrough.
