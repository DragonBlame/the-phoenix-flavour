## Initialisation

After starting a new game, you will be dropped in the **Alternate Start - Live Another Life** cell where you can customise your character, then configure your mods before you actually start playing.

Stand still and wait until all messages have run through in the upper left corner (check the screenshot below). Then hit **ESCAPE** and create a manual save before you continue.

Thanks to SkyUI, it is possible to configure most mods directly through their Mod Configuration Menu – or MCM for short – which you can access through the main menu. Hit **ESCAPE** and select **MCM**. See recommended changes for most of the guide’s MCMs below.

## A Matter of Time

- You can either:
  - Configure the clock widget to your liking.
  - Untick **Show** for each module in the **General** tab to hide it until you are ready to customise it.
  - If you installed my personal AMOT preset, go to **Presets** and click **Load user settings** (see screenshot).

## All Geared Up Derivative

- In the **NPC** tab, check **Enable Weapons**.

## Cathedral Weathers

- Uncheck **Configuration Spell** (redundant when you can access the MCM).

## Genuinely Intelligent Soul Traps

This mod - while focusing on bug fixes and soul gem multithreading - comes with some very nifty level requirement options. If you like, you can set level requirements for each of its special features as well as the for capturing of each tier of souls. Toggle and adjust this system in the **Leveling** tab.

## Growl - Werebeasts of Skyrim

* Toggle on **Invulnerable During Transformation**.

## Immersive HUD

### Toggle Settings (optional)

- You can change the hotkey to display the HUD here.
- I recommend turning on the **Key Press Toggles** option but that is a personal preference.

### Link Widgets (optional)

- Check **Link ALL SkyUI Widgets**.

> If you installed A Matter of Time, this will link the clock widget to the HUD so that it gets toggled alongside the other components (such as the compass).

## moreHUD

- In the **Enemy's Level** tab, uncheck the following options:
  - Show Magicka Meter
  - Show Stamina Meter

> These only clutter up the interface in my opinion. You can also disable Health numbers if you like.

## Realistic Water Two

* Under **Mod Options** >> **Blacksmith Forge Water**, toggle the following options:
  * Kynesgrove
  * Rorikstead

## Storm Lightning

By default, the lightning storms with this mod are pretty intense. I'd suggest changing to a different preset (above "default") to tone them down a little.

- Under **Presets**, select any one on one of the options.

## Timing Is Everything

Another large MCM, and one you should configure now, at the start of the game as it affects many quests that start very early on in Vanilla. You can either leave the settings on default, tweak them, or apply my preset that we installed earlier. You can also apply my preset and *then* tweak whatever you dislike about it.

To apply the custom preset, do the following:

- Go to the **Extra Options** tab in the Timing Is Everything MCM.
- Click **Load Preset** and confirm.
- You will be asked not the leave the MCM before the process is complete. Confirm again.
- All values will be updated. Click **Okay** to close the final message box.

## Trade & Barter

- Under **Barter Rates** >> **Settings**, check the **Modify Barter Settings** box.

![Trade and Barter MCM](/Pictures/skyrim-se/new-game/trade-barter-mcm.jpg)

## Wonders of Weather

This is optional and personal preference.

* Under **Rainsplashes**, set **Level** to **Disabled** to turn the effect off.

## Starting the game

Once you’re done configuring everything, save the game manually. Then talk to the Statue of Mara, select one of the options and interact with the bed in the corner to truly start your playthrough.

As for the options, going with the `vanilla start` is entirely possible but you can also choose the `I am camping in the woods` option for a faster alternative that drops you in the same region but skips the cart ride and execution sequence. It is NOT recommended that you choose the `vampire lair` option as that has been known to cause issues with vampire mods.

> For the best experience **I recommend the vanilla start** as it is impossible to balance all the various options that AS LAL offers.

**Good luck and have fun!**
