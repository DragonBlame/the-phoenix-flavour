## Preset Selection

The Phoenix Flavour is using **Rudy ENB** for Cathedral Weathers. Rudy ENB has been around since the Classic Skyrim days and enjoys a reputation of one of the most feature-rich and highest quality presets. The performance impact is noticeable but should not render the game unplayable on decently modern systems @1080p. Settings can be tweaked or disabled in order to gain more frames.

## Create a new preset

* In ENB Man, click the arrow under **Presets** and select **Blank preset**.
* Enter a name for the new preset: `Rudy ENB - for Cathedral Weathers [1.0]`.
* Click the green checkmark to confirm.

## Import the preset

* Manually download the main file from [Rudy ENB for Cathedral Weathers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39113?tab=files) mod page.
* Navigate to `Your Modding Folder\temp`.
* Open the downloaded ENB Preset archive and navigate to `Rudy for SSE 1.0 CW\! Catherdral Weathers Version\[ Skyrim SE folder ]`.
* Extract all files into your **temp** folder:
  * enbseries
  * enblocal.ini
  * enbseries.ini
* Drag-and-drop all files from the **temp** folder into ENB Man.
* Click **No** both times when asked to add the palettes to ENB Man.
* Remove all files inside the **temp** folder.

> Extracting the files into **temp** before importing them into ENB Man is done because importing directly from the ZIP archive can be a little buggy at times (skipping files and such).

*Reference picture shows a different preset but the process is the same.*
