  Installing Serio's ENB preset.
---

## Preset Selection

The Phoenix Flavour is using **Serio's ENB**, a lightweight but beautiful Cathedral Weathers preset that doesn't break vanilla image spaces (night eye will work) and features different LUTs. It requires some tweaking to perfect it for our setup but that is well worth it.

## Create a new preset

* In ENB Man, click the arrow under **Presets** and select **Blank preset**.
* Enter a name for the new preset: `Serio's ENB - for Cathedral Weathers [1.10]`.
* Click the green checkmark to confirm.

## Import the preset

* Manually download the main file from [Serio's ENB - Cathedral](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30506?tab=files) mod page.
* Navigate to `Your Modding Folder\temp`.
* Open the downloaded ENB Preset archive and double-click the folder inside.
* Extract the following files into your **temp** folder:
  * enbseries
  * enblocal.ini
  * enbseries.ini
* Drag-and-drop all files from the **temp** folder into ENB Man.
* Click **No** both times when asked to add the palettes to ENB Man.
* Remove all files inside the **temp** folder.

> Extracting the files into **temp** before importing them into ENB Man is done because importing directly from the ZIP archive can be a little buggy at times (skipping files and such).

*Reference picture shows a different preset but the process is the same.*
