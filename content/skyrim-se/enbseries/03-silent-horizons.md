  Installing the Silent Horizons ENB preset.

## 3.1 Preset Selection

For the purposes of this guide we will be using **Silent Horizons ENB**, a feature-rich and extremely customisable preset. The instructions are primarily for teaching purposes, however, and the next step (04 Additional Presets) contains more recommended presets with instructions that you are free to install and try as well. 

## 3.2 Create a new preset

* In ENB Man, click the arrow under **Presets** and select **Blank preset**.
* Enter a name for the new preset, e.g. `Silent Horizons - for Obsidian Weathers [7.1]`.
* Click the green checkmark to confirm.

## 3.3 Import the preset

* Manually download the following file from the [Silent Horizons ENB](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/21543?tab=files) mod page:
  * A) Silent Horizons ENB for Obsidian Weathers
* Navigate to `Your Modding Folder\temp`.
* Open the downloaded ENB Preset archive and double-click the **Silent Horizons 7.x Obsidian Weathers** folder inside.
* Extract all files into the **temp** folder:
  * enbseries
  * enblocal.ini
  * enbseries.ini
* Drag-and-drop all files from the **temp** folder into ENB Man.
* Remove all files inside the **temp** folder.

> Extracting the files into **temp** before importing them into ENB Man is done because importing directly from the ZIP archive can be a little buggy at times (skipping files and such).

## 3.4 Activate the preset

* Select the latest version of ENBSeries under **Binary** and tick the checkbox.
* Click the green checkmark at the bottom of the window to install the preset.
