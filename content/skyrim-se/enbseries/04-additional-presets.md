Switching between presets is easy and can be done anytime. In order to uninstall a preset, all you need to do is click the <span style= "color: red"><i class="fas fa-ban"></i></span> button and all files will be removed from your root folder. Create another preset following the steps outlined in Step 3 and click the green <span style= "color: green"><i class="fas fa-check"></i></span> button to deploy it. While it's not possible to install more than one ENB preset at a time, you can add as many as you like to ENB Man and switch between them at will.

## 4.1 The Truth ENB

The Truth ENB is a very light preset by phinix (the author of the popular Phinix Natural ENB for SLE). The Truth is a very performance-friendly preset, designed to enhance the vanilla visuals with color correction and select ENB features. It includes the Night Eye fix which phinix originally wrote for the preset.

- Create a new preset in ENB Man for The Truth ENB.
- Download [The Truth ENB](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9162?tab=files) (main file or LITE version) from the Nexus page.
- Extract all files to `Your Modding Folder\temp`:
  - enbseries
  - enblocal.ini
  - enbseries.ini
- Drag the files from there into the empty **Files** field in your new ENB Man profile.
- Click **No** when asked to import palettes.
- Delete all files in the **temp** folder.

## 4.2 Rudy ENB

Like The Truth ENB, Rudy is based on a prestigious SLE preset by the same name. That's where the similarities end, however. Rudy utilises almost all features of ENBSeries and can have a sizeable performance impact (although not as much as the SLE version). It does include phinix' night eye code but it's an old ESP-based implementation. The visuals are striking a good balance between fantasy and realism, leaning towards the former.

## 4.3 Visceral ENB

My long-time favourite preset, Visceral ENB, is warm and dreamy but still natural enough and exceptionally performance-friendly. It is slightly outdated at this point and has a few issues, however. It does not support vanilla image spaces (Night Eye, etc) and users may experience "white outlines" around their character in certain situations. Please follow the instructions below regardless. Even if you are not planning to play with Visceral, they will teach you how to install presets with ENB Man. You can then select and install any presets from Step 4.
