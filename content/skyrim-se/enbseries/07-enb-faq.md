## Are there performance-friendly alternatives to ENB?

Yes, but none of them come close to achieving the same effect.

#### Obsidian Weathers MCM

With the default guide setup, you can use the mod configuration menu for **Obsidian Weathers** to tweak the general tone and colour settings. There are several presets to choose from.

#### IMAGINATOR

There is also the mod [IMAGINATOR](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4577) by Gopher, created to replace the colour customisation ENB offers. While it should not have a performance impact at all, it is not comparable to ENBSeries. For some people it may still be worth the performance gain. Feel free to try it out.

Please note that IMAGINATOR is a not officially included in the guide, meaning I will provide no installation instructions and no support for issues with the mod.

#### ReShade

Unlike ENBSeries, ReShade was not specifically created for Skyrim SE and has no way to interact with the engine for advanced effects. It is however a very capable, customisable and performance-friendly FX injector that may replace ENBSeries for those with weaker hardware (or different preferences with regards to visuals).

The [ReShade Framework](https://reshade.me/) is easy enough to install, however depending on your chose preset, you may require a certain version of it, or a specific set of shaders. To find presets, just search for **Reshade** on the  Special Edition Nexus. A word of warning though: There are still plenty of ENB-ReShade presets floating around which were made for both ENBSeries and ReShade to complement each other. Take care and read the mod page before installing.

Creating your own preset is arguably easier with ReShade than ENBSeries. ReShade can also be edited and customised ingame.
