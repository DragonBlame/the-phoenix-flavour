## ENB Presets

When deciding for a preset, there are several factors to take into account:

- Is the preset compatible with my weather overhaul?
- Do I like the preset visually?
- How easy is the preset to customise?
- How noticeable is the performance impact?
- Does it break vanilla imagespace?

Visuals are obviously subjective while performance depends on your hardware. You will likely have to install and test a preset before being able to decide whether you like it or not. Screenshots and showcase videos can be found on the mod pages for most presets.

Customisability can be a relevant aspect; however, it is important to note that any ENB preset can be tweaked in any way you want. It's just simpler for some that have integrated certain options into their UI (toggling letterbox, changing LUTs, etc).

All presets recommended here are made for or have options for Cathedral Weathers.

### Vanilla Imagespace Compatibility

A final consideration would be compatibility with vanilla imagespaces, specifically the **Nighteye** effect which you have access to as a Khajiit or vampire of any race.

Some ENBs (including Rudy ENB) are **not compatible** with image spaces so that you will not see a difference when toggling night vision. Others have a fix inbuilt (which is typically active by default). Since TPF has reasonably bright interiors as well as QuickLight (a toggleable torch effect), night vision is not as relevant.

However, if you wish to use **Nighteye**, you need to install a preset that is compatible with vanilla imagespaces.

## Installation

Any of the presets below can be installed as detailed in the previous step with Rudy ENB. Create a new profile in ENB Man, give it an appropriate name, copy over the files, make sure you have selected the latest ENB binaries, and click the green checkmark to deploy.

You can switch between presets anytime.

**Remember to always extract the preset files into the temp folder before importing them into ENB Man.** Otherwise files might be skipped and the preset will not look as intended.

## Recommended Presets

### Rudy ENB

*This is the default option, installed in the previous step.*

As one of the oldest and most popular ENB presets for both versions of Skyrim (SLE/SSE), Rudy ENB has been the default for TPF ever since its Cathedral Weathers edition was released. It is a fully featured preset using almost all features and effects available including custom per-weather settings.

- **Features:** Rudy ENB utilises almost all features of ENBSeries.
- **Performance:** Rudy ENB has a medium to strong impact on performance.
- **Nighteye:** Rudy ENB is not compatible with Vanilla image spaces.

### Serio's ENB for Cathedral

Serio's is a good, performance-friendly alternative to Rudy and a personal favourite of mine. It does need some tweaking in order to look good with Luminosity, our lighting overhaul. You can find the instructions in the guide later on (New Game >> ENB Tweaks).

- **Features:** Serio's ENB features all basic effects plus many custom LUTs.
- **Performance:** Serio's ENB has a light to medium impact on performance.
- **Nighteye:** Serio's ENB is compatible with Vanilla image spaces.

### Silent Horizons ENB

Silent Horizons is an incredibly customisable preset available for a range of different weather overhauls, including Cathedral. The mod page features indepth instructions for customising the preset.

- **Features:** Silent Horizons ENB includes a wide range of features and many customisation options.
- **Performance:** Silent Horizons ENB has a medium impact on performance.
- **Nighteye:** Silent Horizons ENB is compatible with Vanilla image spaces.

### Semirealis ENB

Semirealis is the Cathedral Weathers ENB by firemanaf who is the creator of many popular ENB presets for Skyrim SE (Skyrim Re-Engaged, Natural View Tamriel, etc). For my taste his presets are too dark across the board and the full quality versions are more performance-hungry than comparable presets.

- **Features:** Semirealis ENB covers all ENB effects and some customisability.
- **Performance:** Semirealis ENB has a strong impact on performance; however, performance options are available.
- **Nighteye:** Semirealis ENB is compatible with Vanilla image spaces.

### The Truth ENB

[Download here.](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9162)

As the ultimate performance preset as Phinix ENB for SLE and The Truth ENB for SSE, this is the best choice for anyone with dated hardware or a dislike towards visually intense ENB presets. Its effects improve but do not radically change the visuals which makes the preset compatible with any weather overhaul out there.

The author, Phinix, is also the original creator of the ENB nighteye fix.

- **Features:** The Truth ENB covers select ENB effects.
- **Performance:** The Truth ENB has a light impact on performance.
- **Nighteye:** The Truth ENB is compatible with Vanilla image spaces.
