## About the guide

Mass Effect 1 had no idea what it was getting itself into. The game launched the incredible, critically acclaimed Mass Effect trilogy, a hero's journey and space opera, the story of Commander Shepard and their companions as they desperately fight to save the galaxy.

However, the game did launch way back in 2008 and it shows. We're going to try and rectify that.

*Please note that there are already a number of modding guides for the Mass Effect trilogy. I am not trying to replace any of them or claiming mine is better. The purpose of this guide is pretty much to bring all the up-to-date and relevant steps in modding ME1 to one place, summarised in such a way that anyone can follow them. Also I'm going through this for my own playthrough and found myself incapable of not documenting everything I do so I might as well publish it.*

## Modding Folder

If you've followed my other guides in the past, you'll be familiar with this step. I keep dedicated folders for each game I mod so that all my downloads are in one place and neatly archived for future use. We will create the folder structure now and come back later to fill it out. The top-level folder will serve as hub for all three Mass Effect games as they are all modded with the same tool.

- Create a new top-level or near top-level folder anywhere on your hard drive (don't waste SSD space on this).
- Rename it to **Mass Effect Mods** or similar.
- Create two new folders inside:

### Mass Effect 1 Folder

- Double-click the new, empty **Mass Effect 1** folder.
- Create several new folders inside:

> Skip the OFFICIAL DLC folder if you own the game on Origins instead of Steam.

### Tools Folder

- Navigate to the empty **Tools** folder.
- Create several new folders inside:
