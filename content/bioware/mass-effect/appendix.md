## FAQ

> Can I use this guide with a pirated copy of Mass Effect 1?

No. Neither myself nor any of the mod or tool authors will support pirated copies of the game. You are also risking crashes and other issues. Just buy the game.

> Can I use this guide with the old disc copy of Mass Effect 1?

I have no idea. I assume that it should work fine.

> Can I play Mass Effect 1 on Ultrawide / 21:9?

Theoretically it should be possible to play Mass Effect 1 with a 21:9 aspect ratio using [Flawless Widescreen](https://www.flawlesswidescreen.org/) and [Mass Effect Ultrawide](https://www.nexusmods.com/masseffect/mods/126). However, the former has been reported to cause crashes while the latter is still in beta. There is also the [A Lot of Videos - Unofficial Ultrawide Edit](https://www.nexusmods.com/masseffect/mods/199) which is several versions behind the main mod.

*I do not own a 21:9 monitor so I'm unable to test these mods or write instructions for them.*

> Crash on launch - application load error 5.

Try launching the game directly through Steam. I was unable to get it running through ME3TMM myself.

Some people reported this issue when the game was not installed in the default directory (`C:\Program Files x86\Steam`) and fixed it by moving the game back to the default Steam game library. Other fixes include running the game in Windows XP compatibility mode or installing [NVIDIA PhysX Legacy drivers](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/physx/physx-9-13-0604-legacy-driver/).

> Can I reach level 60 in my first playthrough?

Not by default. The XP Rescale mod allows you to comfortably gain enough experience to reach max level in one playthrough; however, level 60 is only unlocked with the **Medal of Honor** achievement which is granted after completing a full playthrough. This can be circumvented/unlocked by importing someone else's completed save (some are available on the [Nexus](https://www.nexusmods.com/masseffect/mods/categories/5/)).
