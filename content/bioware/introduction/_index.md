  About my Bioware modding guides.

## Overview

While modding Bethesda games is a long-standing tradition, there is another developer of classic RPGs with extensive mod support: Bioware. Mods available for games of the Mass Effect or Dragon Age franchises are typically not quite as complex and large in scope as those for Bethesda games and there are far fewer available. Nevertheless, the modding scene for Bioware games is substantial and talented, helping iconic games such as Mass Effect keep up with the modern standards.

I have been in love with Mass Effect and Dragon Age for a very long time but curiously enough never got into modding them. This year I decided to rebuy Mass Effect 1 on Steam to celebrate N7 day with another playthrough and properly mod the game this time around. About an hour into the endeavour, I realised I can't mod a game without documenting every step of the way. And here we are.

### Differences to Bethesda Games

Be aware that modding Bioware games is very different from Bethesda games and I lack the years of experience that I benefit from when working on Skyrim. My Mass Effect modding guide is based on research and links sourced from all over the internet that I condensed into one streamlined write-up for the sake of convenience. It is far shorter than TPF for Skyrim and very much in keeping with my "vanilla plus" obsession, that is a focus on improving the original game rather than adding to it.

### Support

These Bioware modding guides are *side projects* and primarily document my own steps in modding these games. As such, I will not be taking requests, updates are not guaranteed, and support will be limited. However, there is a Bioware corner on our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/BpwXX5f) where any questions and discussions related to Bioware games are very welcome.

## Games

As you can see, there is only a guide for Mass Effect 1 available at the time. I plan to write companion guides for ME2 and ME3 as I replay the series as well as guides for the Dragon Age games at some point. Of the latter I am currently taking a break so it may be a while yet. My focus certainly remains on Bethesda games and Bioware modding is simply something I do on the side when the mood strikes me.
