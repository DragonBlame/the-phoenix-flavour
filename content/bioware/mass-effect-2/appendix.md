## FAQ

> Can I use this guide with a pirated copy of Mass Effect 2?

No. Neither myself nor any of the mod or tool authors will support pirated copies of the game. You are also risking crashes and other issues. Just buy the game.

> Can I use this guide with the old disc copy of Mass Effect 2?

I have no idea. I assume that it should work fine.
