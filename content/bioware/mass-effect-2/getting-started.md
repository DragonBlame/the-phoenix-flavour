## About the guide

Widely considered to be the best entry in the series, Mass Effect 2 takes the space opera epicness of its predecessor and dials it to 11. It's a fantastic, well-written game with largely improved gameplay and a ton of cool missions. Having been published in 2010, the game does look aged and so the purpose of this guide is to freshen it up with the sharp textures and clean lighting that it deserves.

### Features

- Instructions for the Origin and Steam versions of ME2

### All Mods

- 

### Requirements

- Mass Effect 2 on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/24980/Mass_Effect_2/) or [Origin](https://www.origin.com/gbr/en-us/store/mass-effect/mass-effect-2).
- A legit Windows 8.1 / 10 installation (64bit).
- [Microsoft Framework .NET 4.7.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net472) for the ALOT installer.
- The [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) file editor.
- An archiving tool like [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) or [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/start.html?&L=0).
- A free (or Premium) account on [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/).
- About 34GB of space, ideally on an SSD (game + mods).

## Modding Folder

If you've followed my other guides in the past, you'll be familiar with this step. I keep dedicated folders for each game I mod so that all my downloads are in one place and neatly archived for future use. We will create the folder structure now and come back later to fill it out. The top-level folder will serve as hub for all three Mass Effect games as they are all modded with the same tool.

> If you followed my guide for Mass Effect 1, you will already have the top-level folder.

- Create a new top-level or near top-level folder anywhere on your hard drive (don't waste SSD space on this).
- Rename it to **Mass Effect Mods** or similar.
- Create two new folders inside:

![Modding Folder Top](/Pictures/bioware/mass-effect-2/modding-folder-top.png)

### Mass Effect 2 Folder

- Double-click the new, empty **Mass Effect 2** folder.
- Create several new folders inside:

![Modding Folder ME2](/Pictures/bioware/mass-effect-2/modding-folder-me2.png)

### Tools Folder

> Skip this step if you followed my ME1 guide, you already have these folders.

- Navigate to the empty **Tools** folder.
- Create several new folders inside:

![Tools Folder ME1](/Pictures/bioware/mass-effect-1/modding-folder-tools.png)
