> **TPF does not use any alternate start mod.** That means that you have to go through the usual carriage ride and intro sequence after starting a new game from the main menu. The glitch present in 4.0 Beta 7 has since been fixed but very rarely users reported other problems with the carriage ride that could usually be fixed with a restart. If you do encounter issues with the intro quest, please report them on Discord.

## A Matter of Time

The clock is hidden by default thanks to Kaio's edit of the MCM script so you only have to interact with its MCM if you want to enable it. You can tweak it or simply load my preset.

If you want to try my personal AMOT preset, go to **Presets** and click **Load user settings** (see screenshot).

## All Geared Up Derivative

- In the **NPC** tab, check **Enable Weapons**.

## Cathedral Weathers

- Uncheck **Configuration Spell** (redundant when you can access the MCM).

## Immersive HUD

- Change the hotkey to display the HUD if X is not convenient for you.
- I recommend turning on the **Key Press Toggles** option but that is a personal preference.
- Check **Link ALL SkyUI Widgets** which will link the clock from A Matter of Time to the iHUD toggle.

## moreHUD

- In the **Presets** tab, click **Load User Settings**.

## Timing Is Everything

- Go to the **Extra Options** tab in the Timing Is Everything MCM.
- Click **Load Preset** and confirm.
- You will be asked not to leave the MCM before the process is complete. Confirm again.
- All values will be updated. Click **Okay** to close the final message box.

Most changes made in the preset are explained in the [Gameplay Guide](/tpf/gameplay-guide).

## Trade & Barter

- Under **Barter Rates** >> **Settings**, check the **Modify Barter Settings** box.

## Wonders of Weather

This is optional and personal preference. Rain splashes will no longer cause crashes even if you leave them enabled.

* Under **Rainsplashes**, set **Level** to **Disabled** to turn the effect off.
