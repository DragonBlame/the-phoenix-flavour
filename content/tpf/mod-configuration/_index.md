> **TPF does not use any alternate start mod.** That means that you have to go through the usual carriage ride and intro sequence after starting a new game from the main menu. The glitch present in 4.0 Beta 7 has since been fixed but very rarely users reported other problems with the carriage ride that could usually be fixed with a restart. If you do encounter issues with the intro quest, please report them on Discord.

## A Matter of Time

You can either:

- Configure the clock widget to your liking.
- Untick **Show** for each module in the **General** tab to hide it completely.
- If you installed my personal AMOT preset, go to **Presets** and click **Load user settings** (see screenshot).

## All Geared Up Derivative

- In the **NPC** tab, check **Enable Weapons**.

## Cathedral Weathers

- Uncheck **Configuration Spell** (redundant when you can access the MCM).

## Immersive HUD

- Change the hotkey to display the HUD if X is not convenient for you.
- I recommend turning on the **Key Press Toggles** option but that is a personal preference.
- Check **Link ALL SkyUI Widgets** which will link the clock from A Matter of Time to the iHUD toggle.

## moreHUD

In the **Enemy's Level** tab, uncheck the following options:

- Show Magicka Meter
- Show Stamina Meter

> These only clutter up the interface in my opinion. You can also disable Health numbers if you like.

## Realistic Water Two

Under **Mod Options** >> **Blacksmith Forge Water**, toggle the following options:

* Kynesgrove
* Rorikstead

## Storm Lightning

By default, the lightning storms with this mod are pretty intense. I'd suggest changing to a different preset (above "default") to tone them down a little.

- Under **Presets**, select any one on one of the options.

## Timing Is Everything

- Go to the **Extra Options** tab in the Timing Is Everything MCM.
- Click **Load Preset** and confirm.
- You will be asked not to leave the MCM before the process is complete. Confirm again.
- All values will be updated. Click **Okay** to close the final message box.

Most changes made in the preset are explained in the [Gameplay Guide](/tpf/gameplay-guide).

## Trade & Barter

- Under **Barter Rates** >> **Settings**, check the **Modify Barter Settings** box.

## Wonders of Weather

This is optional and personal preference. Rainsplashes will no longer cause crashes if you leave them enabled.

* Under **Rainsplashes**, set **Level** to **Disabled** to turn the effect off.
