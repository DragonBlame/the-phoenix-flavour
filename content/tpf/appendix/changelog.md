## Release 4.5

> 06/04/2021

It is done! TPF 4.5 is the biggest update since 4.0 and I spent altogether too long chewing on it. As a result, the risk of me having missed something (typos, unfinished sentences, any sort of weirdness) is even higher than usual. Therefore I would ask you to consider TPF 4.5 a **beta release** that will probably get some much needed polishing in 4.5.1 and potentially further small updates.

- Thanks to No Grass In Objects and grass cache, we now have extended grass range which allows for better distant blending.
- TPF is now using the new DynDOLOD 3.0 which is still in Alpha but perfectly functional.
- Some mods (Extended UI, QuickLoot) were moved to the new addon, TPF-X.
- Added new enemy types, a better console UI, an overhaul for Shouts, tweaks for bounties and quest rewards, and more.

**Removed mods:**

- **Prince and the Pauper:** While the FOMOD includes a Gamwich retexture option, most of the included clothing is still painfully low res. There *is* an upscale on the Nexus but frankly it cannot really be described as a visual improvement. I prefer having a smaller collection of children's clothing with consistently high quality textures.
- **JK's Cities Lite:** Has some issues with clipping and flickering that I cannot fix (no permissions) and the author of the lite version has been inactive for a long, long time.
- **Arthmoor's town additions:** Aka Arthmoor's awkwardly squeezed in houses. They don't look great and nobody is going to actually notice that some NPCs don't have homes.
- **Cathedral Landscapes:** A great concept that never received the updates and improvements it desperately needed. We switched to other mods that offer better grass and a similar degree of distant blending with custom terrain LOD.

#### Initial Setup

- **INI Files:** Godrays should always be set to "High" now.

## Global Site Update

> 08/03/2021

I finally did some spring cleaning. For the longest time it annoyed me that in my original folder structure I had categorised pages by games, for example the TPF part of the website was called "Skyrim SE" in the top menu. But what if I want to start another SE project? And you don't want to know the chaos in my pictures folder either.

The reason I hesitated for so long to change the folder names is because it breaks every, single, link. And while fixing the internal links and file paths was merely a minor annoyance, fixing all external links is more difficult - especially considering that other people may link to TPF as well and those links are now broken. Of course I also need to recompile both TPF and WTP for Wabbajack to update the links that open automatically upon installing a Wabbajack list.

Well, I finally updated now and I'm very happy with the changes. It likely will take some time for all external links to get fix plus I suspect I may have missing some internal links and file paths.

#### Changes

- Removed the Bioware section (see below).
- Renamed "Skyrim SE" to "The Phoenix Flavour" (link changed from skyrim-se to tpf).
- Renamed "Fallout 4" to "Welcome to Paradise" (link changed from fallout to wtp).
- Updated all internal links and file paths - hopefully.
- Cleaned up my pictures folder to remove any pictures that are no longer in the guide.
- Updated the home page, it has two buttons now and a combination of the TPF and WTP pics.

#### Bioware

The current state of things is that I have published a guide for ME1 with a draft for an ME2 version waiting for revision. But here's the thing: Modding Bioware games is quite different from modding Bethesda games. I've only really dipped my toes in it and wouldn't call myself an expert by any stretch of the imagination. Something I often criticise about various smaller Skyrim modding "guides" is that their authors barely know what they're doing. It occured to me that my Mass Effect "guides" are in essence the same thing ~~with better formatting~~.

To keep a longer story short, I have developed a strong sense of imposter syndrome over those excursions into Bioware land that is causing me a fair amount of stress. Something I've learned over the past couple years is that if you have too many things putting pressure on you at once, cut out everything that's non-essential. Well, this time the scissors are for the Bioware section of the TPF website.

## Release 4.4.2

> 07/03/2021

This update contains some more 4.4 fixes but also a bigger update for the **Cathedral Armory - TPF Repack**. Specifically, I added Armor Mesh Fixes and added meshes from the existing Cath Armory patch to my repack.

I also added **Practical Female Armor** meshes patched for Cath Armory by **Asator**. Several armors will no longer have boobplates: Nordic Carved, Elven, Steel Plate, and Wolf. These are in my opinion the worst offenders and the ones that actually annoy me. I may add PFA meshes for Ebony armor in the future.

#### Updating instructions

- Double-click **SSE Engine Fixes** and set `SleepWaitTime=` to `false` again. This is so there is enough time for the new NPC AI Process Position Fix to do its job.
- Regenerate **AllGUD**.

#### Mod Installation

- **SSE Engine Fixes:** Removed INI tweak for SSE Engine Fixes.

## Release 4.4.1

> 04/02/2021

Fixed a bunch of embarrassing typos, both in the guide and in the 4.4 changelog.

#### Mod Installation

- **Fixes:** Added No Grass In Caves (undocumented 4.4 addition).
- **Graphics Baseline:** Fixed part of High Poly Project FOMOD instructions being illegible.
- **Clutter:** Added Deer Skull and Antlers (undocumenteed 4.4 addition).
- **Apparel & Weapons:** Actually removed Sunhallowed and Bloodcursed Weapons - HD Retexture from the page.

#### Finalisation

- **ENBSeries:** Incorporated a suggested improvement to the Global INI Settings instructions.

## Release 4.4

> 04/03/2021

**Removal of High Poly Vanilla Hair:** This mod was TEMPORARILY removed as the current version has clipping issues on vanilla heads. The author only tested with High Poly Head but unfortunately did not set that as a requirement. They are apparently working on a fix and the mod will be re-added when that fix is available.

**Removal of Forgotten Retex Project:** While this is a great compilation of various mods, I prefer to hand-pick at the end of the day. As more conflicting mods were added, the list of files to delete from this mod grew further and I decided to simply remove it. Similar to HMB II (Cathedral NPCs) many of the mod previously included in the big package were now re-added separately.

**Removal of Skyrim 3D Misc - Tanning Rack:** Ok, so hear me out. Mathy does great work. Incredible meshes. They are so good, in fact, that every time I come across a tanning rack, I can't help thinking "that's a 2021 mesh in my 2011 game". Yes, I removed a mod because it's too well made.

**Removal of Practical Female Armor Changes:** This one will upset people, and trust me, the return of the boobplate doesn't make me happy either. But with the PFA meshes and Cath Armory meshes, and lacking the skills to implement the changes from either mod into the other, I had to make a decision. Will probably be re-added at some point when I've figured out how to patch the meshes.

#### Updating Instructions

## Release 4.3.2

> 25/02/2021

The update is **save-safe**. Upon loading a save, you will be warned about a "missing plugin" because the CRP was renamed. Since the plugin is still present (only under a different name) and had no direct masters, this is harmless and you can simply click OK.

#### Initial Setup

- **Mod Organizer 2:** Added instructions to download the old 2.3.2 version of Mod Organizer 2.

*Support for MO2 2.4.0 will come eventually but we will wait until most Antivirus tools have flagged the new version as harmless in their databases. They are known to quarantine parts or the entirety of MO2, usually because of the UVFS.*

#### Mod Installation

- **Visual FX:** Removed Voltage.
- **Visual FX:** Removed Voltage - KZG Chroma Pack.
- **Visual FX:** Added Thunderbolt - HD Lightning.
- **Assorted Plugins:** Added Vampires Cast No Shadows.

*LOD and Occlusion were not regenerated.*

## Release 4.3.1

> 24/02/2021

No changes to the manual guide or Wabbajack (although an actual content update is coming soon).

I added a new section called [**TPF Addons**](/tpf/tpf-addons/) to officially feature the various Addons created by third parties. These range from integration patches (Legacy of the Dragonborn and Creation Club content) to small collections to be installed on top of an existing TPF setup. Sr Kaio's and D1Z4STR's Addons are for the small touches while Slidikins' Strenuous Skyrim is made to increase the overall difficulty. Different Addons cater to different tastes!

**If you are interested in Addons:** Please, please read the [Addon Primer](/tpf/tpf-addons/addon-primer) I wrote before installing anything. The page will take you through the rest of the section and supply you with everything you need to know.

I am also working on an Addon of my own with some changes that I cannot put into the main guide. Stay tuned for updates!

#### Wabbajack Installer

- Update aMidianBorn Armor Variants Lite to 1.2
- Updated Horses for Followers to 1.1

## Release 4.1.1

> 13/02/2021

#### Mod Installation

- **Food & Ingredients:** Actually removed Unique Stros M'Kai Rum from the mod installation section.

## Release 4.1

> 10/02/2021

As it turns out, the Timing Is Everything preset feature is broken. I hadn't previously noticed it as I didn't check *all* the pages and on the "Extras" page everything seemed to work well. Umgak fixed that in scripts packaged with the CRP. The preset itself was updated for even better synergy with other mods in TPF, ensuring quests will not be available before you are capable of beating them. Details can be found on the new [Quests](/tpf/gameplay-guide/quests) page in the Gameplay Guide.

While working on the Quests segment of the Gameplay Guide, I noticed that it was rather inconsistent to use Andrealphus' Dawnguard DLC integration option for the Stones of Barenziah (No Stones Unturned) but not the Dragonborn DLC one. So I fixed that.

#### Mod Installation

- **Landscape:** Changed Blended Roads instructions to simply use the Medieval Bridges optional file.
- **Food & Ingredients:** Removed Unique Stros M'Kai Rum (encountered a CTD in connection with it that needs further investigating).
- **Apparel & Weapons:** Added instructions to install the new hotfix for LeanWolf's Better-Shaped Weapons.
- **Improved Vanilla Quests:** Added Buyable Golden Claw.
- **Improved Vanilla Quests:** Added instructions to download Andrealphus' Gameplay Tweaks - Stones of Barenziah - Solstheim.
- **College of Winterhold:** Added instructions to select the Viewable Faction ranks patch in the Obscure's COW FOMOD.
- **Miscellaneous:** Added Viewable Faction Ranks.

#### Mod Configuration

- Rephrased instructions for Timing Is Everything so applying the preset no longer feels optional.

#### Gameplay Guide

- **Quests:** Added a new page to cover changes to quests, level requirements, etc.

#### Conflict Resolution Patch

- **4.0.1:** Updated for Adamant 4.2.7
- **4.0.1:** Fixed the preset functionality in tie_mcmscript.pex
- **4.1:** Reverted amount of pamphlets to be distributed in the Spread the Love quest to vanilla (30 > 20)

## Release 4.0 Beta 7

> 29/01/2021

With the removal of Fuz Ro D'oh and new instructions for Keyboard Shortcuts Fix, the Clean-up page has essentially become redundant and was removed.

## Release 4.0 Beta 6

> 29/01/2021

With this update, **Alternate Start - Live Another Life** (aka AS LAL), got the boot. Gonna be honest here, I've been meaning to remove that mod for a long, long time. Unfortunately, there never was a simple alternative to it that just puts you in a quiet place to go through MCM settings and character creation before the vanilla start. And, spoiler alert, there still isn't.

However, I discovered that the vanilla start - once a buggy mess in modded games - works perfectly fine in TPF. This is due to the fact that most mods no longer instantly fire all their scripts as soon as you start the game and we have very mods that run many scripts anyway. The overall stability of SSE and the decoupling of framerate and physics are helping here as well.

Without AS LAL, everyone is forced to go through the vanilla intro which makes balancing far easier for us. There is simply no way we can balance every single one of AS LAL's starting points so that it's a fair start for a new playthrough. I always recommended the vanilla start anyway. Additionally, AS LAL touches so many parts of Skyrim that it's essentially patching hell. Now we are rid of that, too.

The downside is that there is no quiet mod configuration spot before you are thrown into the game anymore. You will probably have to take a breather after escaping Helgen or later in Riverwood for the MCM stuff. I miss the convenience of the AS LAL cell but it's a small part of the mod and doesn't justify keeping the rest.

**Website structure:** As you may have noticed, I moved around some pages and added a new (WIP) Wabbajack page. The purpose of this is to have a clear distinction of guide sections for manual and for WJ users.

#### Introduction

- Temporarily removed link to mod spreadsheet (very outdated, will get to it).
- Added link to the new [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj_QypS-aCNNyUBLpYsFAeCJk1Zq0xnmV) with music tracks added by mods in TPF.
- Expanded the Wabbajack section and added a FLOWCHART to make it obvious which sections WJ users need to follow.

#### Initial Setup

- **Mod Organizer 2:** Rewrote the Separator section to have DIY instructions (users make their own separators).
- **ESM Cleaning:** Actually fixed Dawnguard manual cleaning instructions (could have sworn I already did this).
- **ESM Cleaning:** Added note to uncheck SSEEdit Backups so that they don't clutter up your Overwrite.

*For Beta Testers: Re-cleaning Dawnguard.esm is not necessary. The problem was that I had custom Filter profiles that I thought were default. Users didn't have them though, so I had to rewrite the instructions without using a filter.*

#### Mod Installation

- **Instructions:** Added paragraph on creating new separators for each new page in the mod installation section.
- **Essential Mods:** Removed Alternate Start - Live Another Life (praise the Nine).
- **Fixes:** Updated FOMOD instructions for Landscape Fixes for Grass Mods (no longer selecting the AS LAL patch).
- **Tweaks:** Removed Multiple Floors Sandboxing (added to ACC).
- **Graphics Baseline:** Fixed file names in additional instructions for aMidianBorn Book of Silence.
- **Graphics Baseline:** Added instructions to delete the scripts folder from aMidianBorn Book of Silence.

- **Dungeons:** Added instructions to Underground to fix the shiny mud in Helgen.
- **Apparel & Weapons:** Fixed download instructions for Sunhallowed and Bloodcursed Arrows (Optional Files > Main Files).
- **Miscellaneous:** Removed Bounty Previews (late note from Beta 1, will be re-added very soon).

#### Finalisation

- **Wrapping Up:** Added instructions to create a new separator before installing the CRP.
- **Wrapping Up:** Removed sandboxcylinderheight.esp from list of plugins to ESL-ify (added to ACC).
- **Nemesis:** Added instructions to add a PATCHER OUTPUT separator.
- **DynDOLOD:** Added instructions to click "Advanced" in the window that comes up when *not* generating 3D tree LOD.
- **Occlusion:** Improved instructions for generating Occlusion (minor rephrasing).
- **First Launch:** Updated for the removal of Alternate Start.
- **Clean-Up:** Moved instructions to check MO2 for errors here.

#### New Game

- Most of the FINAL STEPS page was redundant except for the MO2 error check which was moved to Clean-up instead.
- The MOD CONFIGURATION page is now a top-level page.
- The GAMEPLAY GUIDE page is now a top-level page.

#### Wabbajack

- Added this new top-level page with instructions for the Wabbajack version of TPF.

#### Mod Configuration

- **Mod Configuration:** This is now a top-level page.
- **Mod Configuration:** Temporarily removed the (fairly pointless) instructions for GIST. Will add proper ones in the future.

#### Gameplay Guide

- **Gameplay Guide:** This is now a top-level page.
- **Gameplay Guide:** Added a far too detailed section about the music mods added in TPF.

## Release 4.0 Beta 5

> 26/01/2021

As you may have noticed, the **ENBSeries** section has vanished from the sidebar. What happened? It was reintegrated. Everything from those pages was moved back into the main body of the guide with ENBMan, binaries, and preset installation being a step in the Finalisation. This was done in order to further streamline the guide and eliminate optional paths and variations.

Also removed was **Nether's Follower Framework** after some internal discussions. Overtime, NFF has grown from a lightweight follower overhaul to an excessively bloated mod doing all kinds of things. While it remains high quality, the vast majority of features are misplaced in a v+ setup. Additionally, combat is easier for us to balance knowing that players are limited to a single follower like in vanilla. Some features of NFF were replaced by other mods.

**New save required** once again because of the removal of NFF. Sorry. =(

> 24/01/2021

Simon's werewolf overhaul is finally out now and replaced Growl which completes our suite of SimonRim mods for gameplay. Because of this and the update Scion received, a new save is required for Beta 4.

## Release 4.0 Beta 1

> 20/01/2021

Update 4.0 for The Phoenix Flavour is firmly taking the setup back to its "vanilla plus" roots. TPF is committing to low-impact mods that blend in well while doubling down on our performance-friendly visual enhancements. Many mods were removed in this update, some of the beloved favourites, but there are solid reasons behind each removal.

New mods include the custom made **Armor Variants Lite** which is an alternative to kryptopyr's CCOR-dependent aMidianBorn Content Addon, created by Umgak from scratch. I also re-added the much requested artifact overhaul **Reliquary of Myth** and completely rebuilt the appearance section which is now centered around **Cathedral NPCs**. And finally Fore's New Idles was replaced with the more recent and open source **Nemesis**.

**Removal of CBBE:** I only ever included CBBE because many people demanded it. It's not required by anything and half the time I have no idea whether a CBBE patch is required or not. I haven't noticed a difference between CBBE / vanilla body in regular gameplay, ever, and I'm sick of worrying that something might not work correctly. I have no idea how to use BodySlide and frankly, I'm not interested in figuring it out. At this point, CBBE is for me personally just additional headache for zero gain. Well, I guess my character's buttcheeks are low-poly now but I can just about live with that.

**Removal of CCOR and RDO:** Both Complete Crafting Overhaul Remastered and Relationship Dialogue Overhaul were removed in this update because of feature creep. In the case of CCOR, the feature creep is subtle but enough to disturb my V+ vibes. Almost all the features that I personally like were implemented by other means with a faction equipment crafting module being on my to do list. RDO was never properly ported to SSE to begin with, nobody is creating patches for it, and it touches a million different things. The effort of integrating it is almost comparable to CRF. I personally doubt I will even notice if it's missing so I removed it as well.

**Removal of ENB Lights:** While it adds some cool effects, I removed ENB Lights for the time being as it is somewhat annoying to handle. It edits plenty of meshes (which means added compatibility work) and isn't properly updated for some of the newer fire mods. I'll likely come back to this mod and reimplement parts of it in a later 4.x update.

**Removal of the Content Addon:** Since [Elysium](https://github.com/TitansBane/Elysium) is now a thing, I no longer feel any sort of pressure to add new content to TPF. First and foremost, the list is intended to improve the gameplay, balancing, and graphics of the base game (and that's difficult enough!). Some extra content mods are still in the guide (those adding equipment variants) as I cannot imagine playing without them.

## Release 3.5

> 05/09/2020

With this update Aetherius and Mundus were added to complement the existing suite of gameplay mods by SimonMagus. Alchemy got a much needed balancing upgrade with the switch to skepmanmods' Alchemy Potions and Food Adjustments and fighting dragons should be less of a headache now after the removal of Simply Stronger Dragons.

Despite the overall trend to remove customisability, I have once again re-added a page on different ENB presets as I feel that this is an easy way for me to allow personalisation. Switching ENB presets is simple, it can be done anytime. Presets are highly dependent on personal taste and I know that I personally switch all the time (haven't had a personal favourite since Visceral ENB). Rudy ENB remains the default but there are now recommendations/links to Serio's ENB, The Truth, Silent Horizons, and Semirealis.

A handful of mods were removed in anticipation of the elimination of optional mods. **However, TPF 3.5 still has optional mods.** I have decided to push this change to the next update so that from 3.6 (or whatever I'll call it) onwards, you will no longer be able to skip currently optional mods (they will all be mandatory).

#### Mod Installation

- **Essential Mods:** Reverted SSE Engine Fixes config file editing instructions to MO2 since it can now open TOML files.
- **Interface:** Removed Hide These Futile Quests (too confusing for people who don't read).

- **Gameplay Overhauls:** Removed Subtle But Classless (could no longer be optional with the addition of Aetherius).
- **Gameplay Overhauls:** Removed the Subtle But Classless - USSEP and EEO Patch.
- **Combat & Encounters:** Removed Simply Stronger Dragons - TPF Repack (makes dragon fights too difficult).
- **Balancing:** Added instructions to download the new Morrowloot Miscellania - No Fortify Enchanting Alchemy Smithing.
- **Balancing:** Added Alchemy Potions and Food Adjustments.
- **Balancing:** Removed Skyrim Alchemy Fixed.
- **Sound Effects:** Removed mod order instructions from Audio Overhaul Skyrim (they should have been gone several updates ago).

#### ENBSeries

- **Other Presets:** (Re-)Added this page, allowing you once again to choose your own ENB preset.
- **Related Mods:** Removed mod order instructions for the TPF ENB Light Patch.
- **INI Tweaks:** Specified that turning on godrays (Volumetric Lighting) is recommended specifically for Rudy ENB.

#### Finalisation

## Release 3.4.5

> 30/08/2020

This is a quick fix-it for the recently reworked Veydosebrom. The new version no longer works with my plugin replacer / Cathedral addon - fortunately, the original Vey is still available for download.

A bigger update, 3.5, is currently in the works. No ETA.

#### Mod Installation

- **Landscape:** Updated instructions for Veydosebrom, downloading version from Old Files.
- **Landscape:** No longer selecting Snowy Farmhouses in the Better Dynamic Snow FOMOD (they don't look great).

## Release 3.4.4

> 10/08/2020

This is a fix-it for yesterday's update because I messed up a surprising amount of stuff some of which was already fixed yesterday but were included in the changelog for completion's sake.  All I can say in my defence is that 34°C in my flat is doing things to my brain.

**Mysticism and Adamant update:** Simon just released a huge update for Mysticism which is going to require us to update the CRP. Do not install the new versions of Mysticism and Adamant until Umgak had the time to update the CRP. You will be pinged on Discord or see the notification for the update on the Nexus if you are tracking TPF there. **Do not ask for an ETA.**

#### Initial Setup

- **Skyrim Script Extender:** Updated instructions, now supporting SKSE 2.0.19 (latest update).

#### Mod Installation

- **Apparel & Weapons:** Actually removed the (optional) flag from Open Face Guard Helmets.

#### Appendix

- **Troubleshooting:** Added section for the enblocal.ini VSYNC and SSE Display Fixes conflict.

## Release 3.4.3

> 09/08/2020

With this update, we are switching to the recently released Rudy ENB for Cathedral Weathers which works better out of the box for our setup. It also utilises almost all ENB features without too much of a performance impact which is pretty impressive.

I've also finally gotten around to fixing up some [personal tweaks](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38348/) and putting them on Nexus. Of course they were added to the guide as well.

#### Initial Setup

## Release 3.4

> 14/07/2020

Welcome to the Make Phoenix Happy Again update, also known as MAPHA. Fuck Trump by the way (in case there are any doubts about my thoughts on the matter).

This update may well be controversial. A good deal of mods were removed in an effort to get back to my vision of a perfect vanilla-plus game. I fully expect that the changes will put off some users and I'm sorry for that, but it's for the best. Removing pretty much all the customisation options (not including optional mods) helps me a great deal with streamlining my work behind the scenes. I have a lot of polishing and small edits in my backlog that I never get to because I'm busy with a million other things.

The intention is not to make TPF smaller, per se. I will be adding a number of mods over the course of the upcoming updates and I do not plan to keep TPF small for the sake of it. It's the overall complexity and therefore the amount of work required that I need to keep reasonably small. I already struggle with a lack of focus and concentration, no need to make things harder for myself.

**Major changes:**

- Added a new Content Addon section that can be skipped completely. It includes the quest and companion mods that weren't yeeted in this update and will likely be expanded in the future.
- Interesting NPCs was yeeted for good. The quality of the mod is somewhat inconsistent and it doesn't blend in at all (and doesn't try to). It is by no means a "bad" mod, but it doesn't fit TPF.
- Arthmoor's Towns were yeeted for good. Supporting two optional sections is just too much work and I don't like them enough to add them to the new Content Addon.
- Obsidian Weathers was swapped out for Cathedral Weathers (again). In order to be able to control visuals better, I have decided to support only a single weather+ENB combo which will be Cath Weathers and Serio's ENB, ensuring working night eye visuals and decent grass blending.
- Wildcat was swapped out for Blade and Blunt. Not only does B&B complement the existing suite of SimonMagus gameplay mods (Adamant, Mysticism, and Arena), it is also more light-weight while at the same time (partly) replacing other tweaks.

**Structural changes:**

- Removed the numbering completely. The reason behind that is that with all the changes to the order of steps / mods I'm making, they are changing constantly anyway. Plus it's a lot of annoying work to keep them updated. So fuck 'em.
- Changed the order of mod installation steps AGAIN. Yes, I've been reshuffling them with basically every major update. I'd like to think that I'm getting closer and closer to perfection, though.
- Patches are no longer moved to the PATCHES separator. You can just leave them where they are in the installation order and the loadorder.txt will move the plugins to the correct spot.

#### Initial Setup

- This step was renamed to Initial Setup, simply because it looks better when the name is longer. Yeah...
- **Mod Organizer 2:** Added instructions to change the background color for the MO2 separators.
- **Mod Organizer 2:** Added instructions for the new OFFICIAL MASTER FILES separator.
- **INI Tweaks:** Updated BethINI Detail instructions (increasing Exterior Draw Distance to 8000).
- **ESM Cleaning:** Added instructions to move the Cleaned ESMs mod folder below the new OFFICIAL MASTER FILES separator.
- **Skyrim Realistic Overhaul:** This step was removed completely. SRO is no longer part of the guide.

## Release 3.3.1

> 13.06.2020

In this update, I primarily focused on restructuring the guide. A *lot* has happened behind the scenes. Step improved much of the theming, especially the dark theme and fixed some remaining issues. We are back on the old domain - thephoenixflavour.com - now with free Cloudflare SSL. It just redirects from foreverphoenix.github.io so it doesn't matter which URL you use. I've been tinkering with more stuff for the guide content but realised fairly soon I was picking up way too many projects at once so most things were put on the backburner until the next update.

Because I've tried and moved and deleted so much stuff, the changelog is probably not complete. Sorry about that. This update kinda ran away from me and became a mess. I hope I didn't horribly break anything.

An new ENBSeries section was added that covers everything related to ENB, including instructions for a new default preset, Silent Horizons ENB. Visceral is still supported and listed under 04 Additional Presets. The mods from the ENB Particle Lights section were moved here to 05 Related Mods. ENB Light is now optional. With these changes, ENBSeries can easily be skipped.

#### Setup

- **6.3:** Updated BethINI instructions to remove ENB-related tweaks. Instructions to disable vanilla AO and increase particle count were moved to the new ENBSeries section.
- **7.2:** Adjusted instructions to link to the new download location for the CAO - Basic Profiles Pack.
- **9.3:** Added instructions to install the new CAO - SRO Profiles Pack.

#### Mod Installation

- Removed Remove Sneak Attack Sounds (feature included in Immersive Sounds - Compendium).
- Moved Frozen Electrocuted Combustion to Customisation.
- Moved ENB Particle Lights page to the new ENB section.
- **2.6:** Updated FOMOD instructions for Skyrim Water and Landscape Fixes (file update).
- **6.2:** Obsidian Weathers and Seasons MCM Patch is no longer optional.
- **21.21:** Realistic Skin Shader for Falmer and Hagravens is no longer optional.

#### ENBSeries

- Added this new section to cover everything related to ENBSeries.

#### Customisation
- **New Music:** This section was moved to the main guide.
- **Misc Mods:** Moved Frozen Electrocuted Combustion here.
- **Plugin Edits:** This section was removed for now. It only included a tweak for Dwemer Spectres which is no longer in the guide.
- **Removing ENB:** This section no longer exists as ENB itself was made completely optional.

## Release 3.3

> 07.06.2020

I re-added the mod installation instructions that I completely missed in the original website setup. Whoops! It's not like they're important or anything. You can find them [here](https://foreverphoenix.github.io/docs/02-setup/step-10/). It's not a straight copy-paste, I re-structured it and re-wrote parts as well. All "generic instructions" (using CAO, resaving plugins, etc) were moved to the [Basic Instructions](https://foreverphoenix.github.io/docs/07-resources/basic-instructions/) page under Resources.

The Mod Installation section itself was split up into four parts to avoid the ugly scrollbar.

The "Unpack Example.bsa" instructions previously contained instructions to delete the BSA afterwards. Some users missed this step and others got confused so I removed it and added instructions to delete the BSA directly to the mod instructions where appropriate. Should be pretty hard to miss now.

Some mods are now flagged as **(conditional)**, meaning they are optional but depend on other mods. You must install a **(conditional)** mod if you installed the mod that it depends on. Otherwise you must skip it.

And finally I added several new mods: **Immersive Sounds Compendium** with DylanJames' new AOS integration patch to the main guide and my favourite new music mods with a merged patch to the Customisation.

#### Setup

- **Step 7:** Removed the zEdit section. zEdit will be re-added to the guide once mator provides ESL support.

#### Mod Installation

- Removed Dwemer Spectres.
- Removed Dwemer Spectres - EBT No Bleeding and Other Fixes.
- Moved Adopt Aventus Aretino from Non-Player Characters (Step 26) to New Mechanics & Features (Step 36).
- **3.9:** Changed download instructions for Realistic Conversation (using a different main file).
- **8.5:** Arctic - Frost Effects Redux is no longer optional (conflict with ISC had to be resolved in the CRP).
- **36.8:** Re-added Irondusk's Saddlebags.
- **37.2:** Added Immersive Sounds - Compendium.
- **37.3:** Added Audio Overhaul - Immersive Sounds Integration.

#### Customisation

- **New Music:** Added this new section with five new music mods and a merged patch.

## Release 3.2.3

> 04.06.2020

Maintenance update.

#### Mod Installation

## Release 3.2.2

> 23.05.2020

Just a small maintenance update. Realistic Water Two received a big update today, then got hidden to fix oversights. It's back up now. You can probably expect a CRP update soon, but for now here are the updated instructions.

For those who use Arthmoor's additional towns from Customisation, there are now instructions for the Lanterns of Skyrim II patches. I missed them previously.

**Wabbajack users:** Stop pestering Lively about fixing the installer. When mods are updated, he has to update his own setup and recompile, and that takes time. Consider the fact that he has a life that includes more than updating the installer the second a mod update drops. Plus when a mod is hidden, like RW2 was today, there is nothing anyone can do and we all have to wait for the mod author to unhide the mod page. 

#### Mod Installation

- 1.9 Added instructions to delete a textures from the Particle Patch (fixes a bug where water spray would look much darker than intended).
- 9.7 Updated instructions for Realistic Water Two.
- 9.8 Added Realistic Water Two Patch Hub.

#### Customisation

- Added missing Lanterns of Skyrim II patch instructions for Arthmoor's Towns.

#### Load Order TXT

- Added new RealisticWaterTwo - Resources.esm

## Release 3.2.1

> 21.05.2020

This is a small update, fixing some 3.2 oversights as well as bringing the guide up-to-date with the latest mod updates (of which there were several).

Most notably, BethINI and the guide's instructions for it were updated. The process of re-doing BethINI is quite simple and detailed in a new FAQ section, [How to redo INI files from scratch](https://github.com/foreverphoenix/the-phoenix-flavour/blob/master/The-Phoenix-Flavour-3-2/06-FAQ.md#how-to-redo-ini-files-from-scratch).
