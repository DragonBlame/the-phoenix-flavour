## New Music

While it is highly unusual for me to be adding new content like music tracks, there are some incredibly high quality music mods out there that I loved to play with. If you played a lot of Skyrim, you ARE going to notice the new tracks so they stick out in a sense but not negatively so. I found it rather refreshing to have a new track to listen to every once in a while and none of them stray too far from the atmosphere created by Jeremy Soule's original soundtrack.

All included music mods contain tracks written specifically for Skyrim. I created a playlist which contains all new music tracks added to Skyrim by mods in TPF which you can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj_QypS-aCNNyUBLpYsFAeCJk1Zq0xnmV). Separate links can be found below.

**The Northerner Diaries**

Speaking of Jeremy Soule, the composer was working on a project called "Northerner Symphony" shortly after the release of Skyrim which was [crowdfunded on Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/499808045/from-the-composer-of-skyrim-soule-symphony-no-1/description) but never saw the light of day. However, several years after the original project was supposed to be completed Soule released the "Northerner Diaries" album containing "sketches" recorded with a virtual orchestra.

Eight tracks from the "Northerner Diaries" album were added to Skyrim in the mod [The Northerner Diaries - Immersive Edition](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/28108) where author took great care to exclude tracks that didn't fit.

You can find the full album on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMAs_C_7Gp4). My personal favourite is the first track, Nj√≥l, with that beautiful piano melody.

**Musical Lore by Nir Shor**

Also included are three tracks by the composer Nir Shor ([Musical Lore](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3200)).

**OrganicView's Music**

And finally I am partial to the tracks composed by OrganicView which are split into four mods: one each for exploration, combat, towns, and taverns.
