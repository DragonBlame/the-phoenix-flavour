Adding widescreen support is a matter of replacing interface mods with compatible versions. Thankfully, there is a central mod page offering widescreen patches for pretty much every interface mod out there.

It's important to remember that some of the files below are **replacers** that overwrite the original mod entirely and others are **patches** that required the original mod.

> At the bottom of the page there is a mod order picture you can refer to if you are unsure about the placement of certain mods.

**I do not own a widescreen monitor so I cannot test any of these mods.**

## Complete Widescreen Fix
