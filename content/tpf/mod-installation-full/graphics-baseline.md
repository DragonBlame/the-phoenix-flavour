#### Download Instructions

* **Main Files:** Ruins_Clutter_Improved_SE_NMM_v3-1
* **Update Files:** Falmer Temple Chandelier >> `merge with the main file`

> The other two update files (fixes) are skipped on purpose. They would be overwritten by other mods.

#### FOMOD Instructions

* **Options:**
  * Custom
* **Custom:**
  * High Resolution Candles
  * HD Catacomb Candles
  * HD Enchanting Stations
  * HD Spider Eggs
  * HD Pots
  * Improved Ruins Doors
  * ~~Improved Dragonclaws~~
  * ~~Subliminal Traps~~

#### Additional Instructions

- Delete the following file(s) and / or folder(s):
  - `meshes\dungeons\imperial\portcullissmall01\`

> The mesh does not work well with Underground's retexture. On the other hand, Underground's imperial door meshes also use that specific retexture so I'd rather keep them and revert the portcullis meshes.
