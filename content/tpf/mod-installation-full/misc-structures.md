##### [Rock-Wall Texture Patches for High Poly Project](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34143?tab=files)

#### Download Instructions

- **Main Files:** A. HPP MM Patch - Main

#### Additional Instructions

While the texture was made for the stone wall mesh from High Poly Project, it also works with Skyrim Landscape Overhaul - Stone Walls. However, we do need to adjust the file name and path for the SLO stone wall mesh.

- Double-click the mod in your mod order and switch to the **Filetree** tab.
- Expand the `\textures\high poly project\` folders.
- Rename **stonewall.dds** to **rockwallrocks3.dds**.
- Rename **stonewall_n.dds** to **rockwallrocks3_n.dds**.
- Rename the **high poly project** folder to **architecture**.
- Right-click the **architecture** folder and select **Create new folder**.
- Name the new folder **farmhouse**.
- Now right-click the new **farmhouse** folder and again select **Create new folder**.
- Name the new folder **stonewall**.
- Move the **rockwallrocks3.dds** and **rockwallrocks3_n.dds** textures into the new **stonewall** folder.
- The resulting folder structure should look like this:

![Stone Wall MM File Path](/Pictures/tpf/mod-installation/stonewall-mm.png)

##### **Real 3D Walls - Majestic Mountains Textures**

Using the Majestic Mountains stone wall texture downloaded previously (Rock-Wall Texture Patches), we are going to replace the Real 3D Walls texture with a copy of it. That way rocks and mountains will look consistent with various farmhouse stone walls.

In order to do so, we will create a new mod folder, set up the correct structure, then copy over the texture, and finally rename it so that it is recognised by the Real 3D Walls mesh.

- Navigate to `\Mod Organizer 2\mods\` and create a new folder called **Real 3D Walls - Majestic Mountains Textures**.
- Within the new folder, create the following folder structure:

`\mods\Mod Organizer 2\Real 3D Walls - Majestic Mountains Textures\textures\architecture\farmhouse\`

- In the **Downloads** pane in Mod Organizer 2, find the **A. HPP MM Patch - Main** file.
- Right-click it and select **Open File**.
- Within the archive, navigate to `\HPP MM Patch - Main\textures\high poly project\`.
- Extract the **stonewall.dds** texture into the **farmhouse** folder that you previously created.
- Rename the texture to **stonewall01.dds**.
- The file path (when viewed in Mod Organizer 2) should look as follows:

![Farmhouse Stonewall File Path](/Pictures/tpf/mod-installation/farmhouse-wall-mm.png)
