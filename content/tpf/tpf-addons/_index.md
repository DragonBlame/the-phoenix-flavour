## About TPF Addons

Once upon a time, The Phoenix Flavour used to be modular. It also had optional mods. The idea was to give the user choices wherever possible and mark mods that are easy to swap as such. However, over time this proved to be enormously cumbersome to maintain on our end. After removing all traces of optional mods and modularity, the overall quality of the guide (and my own motivation to work on it) sky-rocketed. Needless to say, it was the right decision and we'll never go back to the pre-3.0 structure.

That being said, we've found a way to allow for some customisation without having to split my own attention between various possible installations. The Phoenix Flavour as the main setup will be completely unaffected by this section and any support for users of either manual guide or Wabbajack version will remain restricted to those with unedited setups.

**Addons** are extensions for the base TPF setup, made primarily by third parties - fellow users. I am also working on an Addon of my own, TPF-X. They are to be installed on top of existing and **unedited** TPF installations, and feature a variety of new mods or integration patches. Addons are **incompatible** with each other, you can only install one.

**If you are interested in using Addons:**

- Install The Phoenix Flavour first, ideally by following the manual guide.
- Test your setup. Play a little. Get help for any issues you may encounter.
- Only THEN should you consider installing an Addon.

If you run into issues after installing an Addon, you may ask for help in the dedicated TPF Addons section on the Discord server where the authors of the various Addons provide support for their tweaks.

> You should start a new character after installing an Addon.

### Wabbajack Users

- There is no Wabbajack version of any Addons.
- Wabbajack users are not *supposed* to install Addons.

Of course Wabbajack users can *in theory* follow the manual instructions for Addons like anyone else but I highly recommend against it. If you did not install TPF manually and have no or little prior modding experience, you are likely to make mistakes or simply miss crucial steps. It's not like I can stop you from installing Addons anyway but I'd consider it a bad idea.

## In Summary

- Installing an Addon **disqualifies** you from getting support on Discord in the `#tpf-guide-support` channel.
- Creators provide **support** for their addon(s) in the `#tpf-addon-help` channels, and only there.
- Addons require **experience** gained during the manual installation for TPF and are not recommended for WJ users.
- Addons should be installed in a **separate** MO2 profile.
- Addons are usually **not compatible** with each other. You can only install one.
