#### FOMOD Instructions

- **Options:**
  - ~~Majestic Mountains~~
  - ~~Green Tundra~~
  - ~~Green Rift~~
  - Gray Beach
  - ~~Projected Snow Maps~~

> We are skipping the Majestic Mountains textures because we are going to remove TT's mountain textures in favour of MM Northside. The snow maps are not needed because we are also not going to use TT's snow.

#### Additional Instructions

- Delete the following file(s) and / or folder(s):
  - `meshes\`
  - `textures\landscape\mountains\`

#### Notes

While Tamrielic Textures is our main landscape retexture, we are hiding a great number of files. As mentioned before, I prefer the mountain textures from Majestic Mountains Northside which is why the mountain textures from TT are removed. I did like the TT snow textures but found them to show some minor tiling in some locations.

The mesh folder is deleted because we need none of its contents. The road and bridge meshes packaged with TT are actually from Blended Roads which we already have installed. The dirt cliff and ice meshes are handled by Better Dirt Cliffs and Alphas and Skyrim Remastered - Glaciers and Ice respectively, both of which will be installed shortly.

##### [MystiriousDawn's HD Skyrim Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19421?tab=files)

#### Download Instructions

- **Optional Files:** LANDSCAPE ONLY TEXTURES - Mid Quality

#### Additional Instructions

Some of the textures surrounding rivers are a tad too bright in Tamrielic Textures for my taste which is why I chose to overwrite them with MystiriousDawn's. You can find a comparison slider [here](https://imgsli.com/NjUwNjM).

- Delete **all files** except those shown in the picture below:
