#### Download Instructions

- **Main Files:** TavernAIFix

#### Additional Instructions

The mod comes with two console commands to customise it. One will prevent innkeepers from showing you to your room, the other will make it so you'll be served whenever you sit down in an inn and not just the first time. Both can simply be added to Autorun Console Commands.

* Double-click **Autorun** in your mod order.
* In the **Textfiles** tab, select **Autorun.txt** and add the following lines:
  * `set TAIF_ServePlayerEveryTime to 1`
  * `set TAIF_ShowRoomNeverShow to 1`
* Press CTRL+S to save and close the window.

The commands will now be executed automatically when you start a new game or load your save.

#### Customisation

You can disable comments that turned into memes ("no lollygagging", "someone stole your sweet roll", "curved swords", "arrow in the knee") by doing the following:

- Double-click **Autorun** in your mod order.
- Switch to the **Text Files** tab and select the **Autorun.txt**.
- Add the following line:
  - `set GDOMemes to 0`
- Close the window and click **Yes** when prompted to save your changes.

> By default, the "curved swords" line will play only until after the Alik'r quest, and the other three lines will no longer play in any hold that the player has become Thane of.
