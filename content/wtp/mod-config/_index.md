  Required and optional MCM tweaks.

## MCM Settings

The first thing you should do after escaping Vault 111 is manually save the game. You've successfully completed the introduction and are now free to explore the Wasteland - after configuring your mods. Thanks to the [Mod Configuration Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/21497), many mods can now be tweaked through the MCM which can be accessed through the pause menu.

Hit **ESC** and open the **Mod Configuration**.

## FallUI

If you chose to install the **FallUI** mods for the interface, you will have several large MCMs with various settings. Feel free to check them out but don't feel pressured to make many changes yet, you can come back here as you play and tweak whatever you disliked.

## Faster Workshop

- Set a hotkey for starting workshop mode. I prefer **Z** (or **Y** on a QWERTY layout).

## GCM (Game Configuration Menu)

### DLC

- Loadscreen Rate **1**

This lowers the chance for Automatron-related loading screens to 1% down from the default 20% to match most other loading screens. It replaces [this tweak](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/21163).

### Experience

- **Workshop:**
  - Base experience **0**
  - Maximum experience **0**
  - Experience multiplier **0**

With all the focus on settlement building including lowered weight for scrap I feel that balance is best served by taking it out of the level-up system entirely. The XP no longer earned by building is somewhat balanced out by the inclusion of PerkPointsPerLevel which grants you 1.2 perks per level up (one additional perk every 5 level ups).

### NPCs

- Dodge chance **OFF**

This disables the weird sidestep / dodge that makes it seem like all NPCs can use the Force and feel your bullet coming.

### Skills

- **Hacking:**
  - Hacking min words **1**
  - Hacking max words **1**

This is optional (personal preference) but if you hate hacking as much as I do, this is how you can disable it. Perk requirements still apply for hacking higher-level terminals but only the correct word will be shown.

Be aware that since Auto Hacking was added in 1.6, you will be able to automatically hack any terminal difficulty that you have the perk for by simply interacting with it. If both tweaks made the hacking minigame *too* trivial for you, then again, feel free to not change the amount of potential passwords.

## Immersive HUD

- Main Settings: **Immersive HUD Enabled**
- Settings Holotape **Off**
- AID Toggle Items **Off**
- Hotkey to Toggle HUD: **X** (personal preference)
- Crosshair - Hitmarker: **Always** (personal preference)

The Holotape and AID item are no longer needed with the MCM and ability to set a keybind directly.

## HoloTime

- Click on **Widget position** and scale the clock down to **0.7** (personal preference).
- Toggle HoloTime Display to **V** (personal preference)

Configuring HoloTime and iHUD can be a little annoying sometimes. Quit the MCM and toggle the HUD on (X), then toggle the clock widget (V). When you toggle off the HUD now, it should also hide the clock. If this doesn't work, try changing the clock scale, then changing it back, or quicksaving, then quickloading the game.

## Photo Mode

In this MCM, you can set a hotkey to go into Photo Mode and change its position in the Pause menu. Feel free to make changes or leave the settings at default.

## Workshop Framework

### Settlement Gameplay

- Shelter Mechanic **OFF**

Just build your settlers' beds somewhere below a roof to protect your immersion and ignore this buggy mechanic.

### Framework Controls

- Manage Workbench **OFF**

The Manage menu accessible at workbenches is only for scrapping stuff placed by the player and the WF layouts feature. Since TPF Fallout 4 doesn't currently include additional layouts, I would rather people disabled this entirely to prevent confusion. If you are interested in WF layouts, re-enable the Manage Workbench option and watch kinggath's tutorials on [importing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3MGiari9xc&feature=emb_logo) and [exporting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OVzgFzjnRw&feature=emb_logo) them. Obviously, downloading and installing layouts counts as adding mods and voids your right to get support for WTP.
