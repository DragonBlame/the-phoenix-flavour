  Installing Wabbajack and downloading WTP.
---

## Installation

- Download the [Wabbajack](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/) executable from the official website.
- Move the downloaded file to `Fallout 4 Modding\Wabbajack`.
- Double-click **Wabbajack.exe**. It will automatically download and install the latest version.

### Downloading WTP

- Once Wabbajack is installed and open, click on **Browse Modlists**.
- Find **Welcome to Paradise** in the list and click the arrow to download.
- Click the dots next to **Installation Location** and choose a path.
- Choose an empty, high-level folder, e.g. `G:\Welcome to Paradise`.

The **Welcome to Paradise** installation folder:

- **SHOULD** be on your SSD or otherwise fastest hard drive.
- **CANNOT** be inside `Fallout 4 Modding\Wabbajack`.
- **CANNOT** be inside the Fallout 4 installation folder.
- **CANNOT** be inside `C:\Program Files` or `C:\Program Files x86`.

### Download Location

The MO2 downloads folder within your Welcome to Paradise folder will automatically be chosen as the download location. However, when installing the setup on an SSD, this would constitute a waste of space and you should use the previously created directory in your modding folder instead. The downloaded mod archives are only required for the initial installation and subsequent updates but not for gameplay.

- Change the **Download Location** file path to `Fallout 4 Modding\Downloads`.
- Click the **Start** button on the left to begin the installation process.

### Troubleshooting

Should anything go wrong during the installation process, please find the **Wabbajack.current.log** file inside `Fallout 4 Modding\Wabbajack\<version number>\logs\`. Upload it (drag and drop) into the `#wtp-support` channel on the [TPF Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/BpwXX5f).

## Game Folder Files

Once the download and installation process has concluded, Wabbajack will inform you about it. In the final step you need to install some files manually as they belong into the root folder which is not handled by Mod Organizer 2. This concludes the installation of the setup.

- Navigate to your Wabbajack installation directory
- Open the **Game Folder Files** folder. Select (CTRL+A) and copy (CTRL+C) all files inside.
- Find your Fallout 4 installation (`Steam\steamapps\common\Fallout4`) and paste all files there (CTRL+V).
