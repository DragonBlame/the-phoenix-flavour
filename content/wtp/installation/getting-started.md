## Requirements

While Wabbajack takes care of 99% of the work, there are still some steps that need to be completed by the user. The **Installation** section will take you through the process from start to finish and you are expected to follow it to the letter.

**You need:**

- A copy of [Fallout 4](https://store.steampowered.com/sub/199943/) with all official DLC (Game of the Year Edition) on Steam.
- A [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4) account, preferably with a Premium subscription.
- Around 25GB for WTP, 13.7GB for the downloaded mods, and 34.5GB for the base game.

Grab a cup of coffee and let's get started.

## Modding Folder

As usual, I recommend creating a dedicated folder that will hold all files *except* for the actual Mod Organizer 2 setup holding all mods. Since these files are exclusively downloads and backups, there is no need to use an SSD. Speed is not required and it would a waste of space.

- On a hard drive with at least 30GB of free space, create a new folder called **Fallout 4 Modding**.
- Create several more folders inside:
  - `Fallout 4 Modding\Downloads`
  - `Fallout 4 Modding\Backups\Creation Club`
  - `Fallout 4 Modding\Backups\Executables 1.10.163.0`
  - `Fallout 4 Modding\Wabbajack`

> Feel free to make use of an existing modding folder if you have one.

## VC Redists

Mod Organizer 2 requires the latest Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable.

- Open the [official VC Redists page](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads) and download the **vc_redist.x64.exe**.
- Run downloaded executable. It will guide you through the installation process.
- You may have to restart your computer in order to finalise the installation.
