While Wabbajack takes care of 99% of the work, there are still some steps that need to be completed by the user. The **Installation** section will take you through the process from start to finish and you are expected to follow it to the letter.

## Requirements

- A copy of Fallout 4 with all official DLC (Game of the Year Edition) on Steam.
- A [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4) account, preferably with a Premium subscription.
- Around 38GB disc space for all mods and archives.

Grab a cup of coffee and let's get started.

## Modding Folder

- On a hard drive with plenty of free space (that is not your SSD), create a new folder called **Fallout 4 Modding**.
- Create several more folders inside:
  - `Fallout 4 Modding\Downloads`
  - `Fallout 4 Modding\Backups\Creation Club`
  - `Fallout 4 Modding\Backups\Executables 1.10.163.0`
  - `Fallout 4 Modding\Wabbajack`

> Feel free to make use of an existing modding folder if you have one.

## VC Redists

Mod Organizer 2 requires the latest Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable.

- Open the [official VC Redists page](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads) and download the following file:
  - **vc_redist.x64.exe**
- Run downloaded executable. It will guide you through the installation process.
- You may have to restart your computer in order to finalise the installation.
