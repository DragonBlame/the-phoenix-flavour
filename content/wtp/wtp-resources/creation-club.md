## Preface

I am not a fan of the Creation Club, whether you want to call it paid mods or microtransactions. That being said, some of my favourite modders have worked on some of the "creations" and there are some I really want to play with. That many of them fit in seamlessly with a vanilla-plus setup makes it even harder to resist.

**Creations are optional.** WTP will never require you to spend extra money on mini DLC.

## Supported Creations

The list is relatively short so far and while I intend to expand it in the future, I am not willing to take requests. These creations are rather pricey and I'm mostly interested in supporting those that I snatched for free anyway.

### Modular Military Backpack

The Modular Military Backpack by fadingsignal (the only reason I spent money on it) is the perfect companion for the K-9 Harness (also by fadingsignal) and highly customisable. I removed the levelled list distribution so there is only a single backpack in the world which you will come across very early on in the game in Vault 111.

Note that because you are able to pick it up before you've even stepped foot in the wasteland, the backpack will invariably hurt overall balancing by awarding generous amounts of extra carry weight and other buffs. I personally don't mind that.
