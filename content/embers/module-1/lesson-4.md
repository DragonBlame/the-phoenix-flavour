 SSEEdit and understanding load order.

## SSEEdit

In the previous lesson, we found a book placed in the Temple of Kynareth that we want to disable while learning more about plugins in the process. In order to look into and edit plugins, we are now going to need another tool:

While plugins can also be created and edited in Bethesda's official modding tool, the **Creation Kit**, the community-made **SSEEdit** is much better suited for beginners to get an idea of how plugins and load order work. Neither of the two replaces the other, and the tool to use always depends on the type of plugin you are working on. For the vast majority of tweaks, edits, and especially patches, SSEEdit is the way to go.

**SSEEdit** is also commonly referred to as **xEdit**. It exists for most Bethesda games, not only Skyrim SE, and its name changes depending on the game: For example, xEdit for Skyrim LE was called TES5Edit. Once you have downloaded the program, you can use it for any game that is supported by either changing the name of the executable or starting it with a specific argument such as `-sse` for Skyrim SE. You will see the tool referred to as **SSEEdit** or **xEdit** interchangeably, it is the same thing.

- Download the latest main file of [**SSEEdit**](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/164).
- Navigate to `\Your Modding Folder\Tools\` and create a new folder called **SSEEdit** inside.
- Open the downloaded archive and extract everything into the new folder.

### Installation

Like almost every other tool, **SSEEdit** can only function if it is run through Mod Organizer 2. Otherwise it will be unable to access the virtual data folder and simply load the official master files which are the only plugins actually located inside the "real" data folder.

- In Mod Organizer 2, click the gears icon in the tool bar to open the **Executables** settings.
- Click the small blue plus icon and select **Add from file**.
- Navigate to `\Your Modding Folder\Tools\SSEEdit\` and double-click the **SSEEdit.exe** within.
- Click **OK** to add the executable to Mod Organizer 2.

### Tool Bar

SSEEdit will automatically be selected in the executables drop-down already. For maximum convenience, I recommend click the **Shortcut** drop-down below the **Run** button and selecting **Toolbar and Menu**.

The SSEEdit icon will now be show up above and clicking it there will be the same as selecting it from the executables drop-down and clicking run. After installing half a dozen tools, it is rather useful to be able to launch everything through that tool bar without having to select it from the drop-down first.

## Ref Cache

We already talked about reference records: They define the placement of various objects in the world. These objects may include books like the USSEP one, but also other items (such as food or weapons), furniture, NPCs, light sources, or invisible triggers (that fire scripts if you cross them). Every last dead shrub in Skyrim has its unique Ref Base ID and REFR record. There are a *lot* of dead shrubs in Skyrim.

In order to save time loading all those thousands upon thousands of references, SSEEdit creates **.refcache** files upon loading a plugin for the first time. These file store the Ref Form IDs, and they *significantly* speed up load times when opening large load orders in the tool (cutting it down from several minutes to 20 seconds or less).

### Generating Cache

While caching is done by default, the files are saved to `\Skyrim Special Edition\Data\SSEEdit Cache\` - or they would, if Mod Organizer 2 did not "catch" them. Since the entire purpose of MO2 is to never have mod files in the **data folder**, it moves files generated by any executable run through its UI to the ***Overwrite*** folder instead. You can see the ***Overwrite*** greyed out at the bottom of your mod order which is where it will always be.

Here is a quick demonstration:

- Click the **SSEEdit** icon in your tool bar to quickly launch the program.
- In the next window you will be asked to select your "modules" or plugins.
- Right-click >> **Select none**, then only check **Skyrim.esm** and click **OK**.
- The log will eventually return `Background Loader: finished`.

On my system, just loading **Skyrim.esm** with all references (and building the refcache file) took 51 seconds. That is just one plugin (although admittedly a rather huge one).

- Close **SSEdit** (just click the X in the top right).

### MO2 Overwrite

Back in Mod Organizer 2, the warning icon in the top right will have lit up. Clicking on it reveals that there were files detected in the ***Overwrite*** which you are warned about because these files would be loaded in the virtual data folder and show up in tools or ingame like any other mods would. They will also take priority and overwrite everything else. The intention behind the warning is to check which files MO2 caught and move them where they belong.

- Double-click the ***Overwrite*** at the bottom of your mod order to check its contents:

In theory, you could create a new mod folder to collect SSEEdit cache in, but that would require you to move the new .refcache files manually every time you add plugins. Fortunately, there is a far more elegant solution.

- Delete the **SSEEdit Cache** folder within the ***Overwrite***.

### Define Output

With the `-c` argument, we can set an output folder for the refcache files generated by SSEEdit. I personally prefer simply generating those files into the tool's installation directory. If you delete its contents before updating to a newer version, the old refcache files will be deleted as well and regenerated the first time you open your load order in the latest version of SSEEdit. 

- In Mod Organizer 2, once again click the gears icon in the tool bar to open the **Executables** settings.
- Select **SSEdit** in the list of executables and add the `-c:"filepath"` argument along with the file path under **Arguments**.

The file path will obviously depend on where you set up Your Modding Folder. It should end in a `\cache\` folder. This folder does not have to exist, it will be created by SSEEdit upon generating the first cache files. For me, the argument looks like this:

- `-c:"F:\Modding\Skyrim SE Mods\Tools\SSEEdit 4.0.3\cache\`

Once you have entered the argument with the correct file path for your system, click **OK**.

Note that the file path **must** end on a trailing backslash `\`. Otherwise it simply won't work, and Mod Organizer 2 will continue to place the .refcache files into the Overwrite.
