## Welcome

Since 2011, we have been at it - modding Skyrim. Update the graphics, improve the gameplay, add a totally new quest. Turn dragons into the latest meme or digitally immortalise a beloved pet. Almost a decade after the release of Skyrim, its modding community is alive and brimming with creativity.

Getting into it is not so easy, however.

Many newcomers are fascinated by YouTube showcases, by gameplay videos and screenshots that turn the aged, washed out Skyrim we know and love into something magical. Building such a setup for yourself requires more dedication than most people expect and that is where trouble starts. With no knowledge of common practices and a lack of comprehensive, up-to-date beginner's guides, new users often capitulate in the face of seemingly inexplicable crashes and buggy mods that never work as advertised.

Here are the facts:

- Modding Skyrim requires time and effort. The larger your setup, the more effort you need to put into it.
- You need a proper mod manager - for Skyrim SE that's Mod Organizer 2 - and you need to know how to handle it.
- You need to understand how your mods work and how you can tweak them so that they work well together.
- You need to have all requirements installed correctly, particularly the Script Extender and the Unofficial Patch.
- You need a proper mod and load order, and no, LOOT is not sufficient.
- You need to download patches for your mods and fix remaining conflicts yourself.

Intimidated yet? Don't be. The above is simply intended to clear up misconceptions among newcomers. A stable modded setup is very much attainable, so let's get started.

## Modding Skyrim

Home is behind, the world ahead - every good journey begins with a Tolkien quote. Before you lies a choice that will determine how soon you will be able to jump into modded Skyrim, and how much you learn on the way. There are three options for you to choose from:

### 1. Using Wabbajack

Learning how to mod Skyrim may not be fun to everyone and if you do not enjoy the process, it is not worth the time investment. Alternatively, some people may be interested in learning, but lack the time to do so. Mod packs do not exist in the Skyrim modding community as sharing permissions are generally very strict (more on that later).

But thankfully there is **Wabbajack**, an auto installer that helps you re-create a more experienced modderâ€™s setup on your computer with minimal effort. There are plenty of different Wabbajack lists available for Skyrim SE. For more information, please check out the [official website](https://www.wabbajack.org/).

### 2. Following a guide

Anyone who wants to learn how to mod Skyrim properly while also being able to start a playthrough reasonably soon should follow a proper guide. They are fantastic resources that will not only provide you with your first modded gameplay experience but also hold your hand on the journey there. While this usually removes a lot of the customisability that modding offers, there are plenty of different guides to choose from that cater to different visions and playstyles. 

I would of course recommend **The Phoenix Flavour**, my own guide which is available [here](https://github.com/foreverphoenix/the-phoenix-flavour). However, there are several more guides for Skyrim SE which different approaches. You can find a detailed overview (including information on content and structure) in the Resources folder on this repository.

### 3. Building your own setup

This is the proverbial jump into very cold water and will require you to invest a good deal of time into reading guides and watching tutorials. You will need advanced understanding of how mods function and the willingness to do a lot of research / trial and error, especially for a larger setup. Nevertheless, for those who enjoy the act of modding itself, the tinkering and customising, the payoff is more than worth it.

If you are determined to build your own setup with your personal favourite mods, check out my beginner's guide, SkyPlus. It provides you with a solid base of modding knowledge and good practices to help you get started.

## Getting started

Unless you already know the basics of modding Skyrim and have a very clear idea of what you want, you are probably not sure which of the options above to pick. I recommend you read through the Modding Basics pages to acquire some basic modding knowledge. It's the first part of SkyPlus, a required read for users of the full guide and will help you understanding a Wabbajack installation as well.
