## MCM Settings

The first thing you should do after escaping Vault 111 is manually save the game. You've successfully completed the introduction and are now free to explore the Wasteland - after configuring your mods. Thanks to the [Mod Configuration Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/21497), many mods can now be tweaked through the MCM which can be accessed through the pause menu.

Hit **ESC** and open the **Mod Configuration**.

## Faster Workshop

- Set a hotkey for starting workshop mode.
  - I prefer **Z** (or **Y** on a QWERTY layout).

## GCM (Game Configuration Menu)

### DLC

- Loadscreen Rate **1**

This lowers the chance for Automatron-related loading screens to 1% down from the default 20% to match most other loading screens. It replaces [this tweak](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/21163).

### Experience

- **Workstation:**
  - Base experience **0**
  - Maximum experience **0**
  - Experience multiplier **0**

With all the focus on settlement building including lowered weight for scrap I feel that balance is best served by taking it out of the level-up system entirely. The XP no longer earned by building is somewhat balanced out by the inclusion of PerkPointsPerLevel which grants you 1.2 perks per level up (one additional perk every 5 level ups).

### NPCs

- Dodge chance **OFF**

This disables the weird sidestep / dodge that makes it seem like all NPCs can use the Force and feel your bullet coming.

### Skills

- **Hacking:**
  - Hacking min words **1**
  - Hacking max words **1**

This is optional (personal preference) but if you hate hacking as much as I do, this is how you can disable it. Perk requirements still apply for hacking higher-level terminals but only the correct word will be shown.

## Immersive HUD

- Main Settings: **Immersive HUD Enabled**
- Settings Holotape **Off**
- AID Toggle Items **Off**
- Hotkey to Toggle HUD: **X** (personal preference)
- Crosshair - Hitmarker: **Always** (personal preference)

The Holotape and AID item are no longer needed with the MCM and ability to set a keybind directly.

## HoloTime

- Click on **Widget position** and scale the clock down to **0.7** (personal preference).
- Toggle HoloTime Display to **V** (personal preference)

Configuring HoloTime and iHUD can be a little annoying sometimes. Quit the MCM and toggle the HUD on (X), then toggle the clock widget (V). When you toggle off the HUD now, it should also hide the clock. If this doesn't work, try changing the clock scale, then changing it back, or quicksaving, then quickloading the game.

## More AGOMBz

### More Attacks

On the **More attacks** page, change the following:

- **Far Harbor creatures:**
  - Allow Far Harbor creatures attacks on The Island **ON**
  - Allow Far Harbor creatures attacks worldwide **OFF**
- **Nuka-World creatures**
  - Allow Nuka-World creatures attacks on Nuka-World **ON**
  - Allow Nuka-World creatures attacks worldwide **OFF**

### More ... Disable

On the **More ... Disable** page, change the following:

- Disable radstags attacks **ON**

> This is done for consistency with the mod [Docile Radstags](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/3208).

## Workshop Framework

### Settlement Gameplay

- Shelter Mechanic **OFF**

Just build your settlers' beds somewhere below a roof to protect your immersion and ignore this buggy mechanic.

### Framework Controls

- Manage Workbench **OFF**

The Manage menu accessible at workbenches is only for scrapping stuff placed by the player and the WF layouts feature. Since TPF Fallout 4 doesn't currently include additional layouts, I would rather people disabled this entirely to prevent confusion. If you are interested in WF layouts, re-enable the Manage Workbench option and watch kinggath's tutorials on [importing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3MGiari9xc&feature=emb_logo) and [exporting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OVzgFzjnRw&feature=emb_logo) them. Obviously, downloading and installing layouts counts as adding mods and voids your right to get support for TPF Fallout 4.
