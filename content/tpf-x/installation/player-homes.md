## Choosing a player home

All player homes featured here can theoretically be installed at once. However, there is very little sense in that and I highly recommend picking out the one that fits your playstyle and skipping the others. Of course you can also install all of them and pick ingame.

Please install all additional files for your chosen player home(s).

## Creation Club

I am currently supporting three player homes from the Creation Club, all made by Elianora. These are the mage tower, Myrwatch, the nord manor, Tundra Homestead, and the thief's den, Shadowfoot Sanctum. The other two (Hendraheim and Dead Man's Dread) may follow at a later date.

In order to be able to control the load order better, we will turn the plugin from an ESM-ESL into an ESP-FE.

- Run **SSEEdit** through Mod Organizer 2.
- Click **OK** to load all plugins and wait for SSEEdit to finish.
- Select **JRShadowfootSanctumPatch.esl** in the left pane.
- On the right under **Record Flags**, right-click and select **Edit**.
- Click **Yes I'm absolutely sure** when the warning pops up.
- Uncheck **ESM** and click **OK**.
- Close SSEEdit and click **OK** to save your changes.

The plugin is now no longer an ESM.

- In Mod Organizer 2, double-click **Unofficial Creation Club Update - Shadowfoot Sanctum**.
- Switch to the **Filetree** tab.
- Rename the plugin from **JRShadowfootSanctumPatch.esl** to **JRShadowfootSanctumPatch.esp**.
