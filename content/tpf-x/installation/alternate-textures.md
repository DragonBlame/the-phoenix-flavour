## Ancient Dwemer Metal

The arguably best (and certainly most popular) retexture for Dwemer metal is SRW0's [Ancient Dwemer Metal](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/75610) which changed the vanilla golden hue to a bronze tone. Although it was never uploaded to the SSE Nexus, it continued to be part of many SSE mod lists and several patches were created in order to cover what the original mod did not touch.

This culminated in the release of [The Dwemer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/49234) which is a collection of the original files as well as subsequent patches and many further tweaks (including cubemap changes for all related meshes).
