## My choices

I'm personally partial to OrganicView's music mods for both Skyrim SE and Fallout 4 as well as Nir Shor's Musical Lore and The Northerner Diaries (composed by Jeremy Soule who also wrote Skyrim's original soundtrack). For the longest time, these mods were part of base TPF until I finally decided to split them off from the main guide and move them to TPF-X.

In Skyrim, nusic is implemented in something like playlists. There are "playlists" for dungeons, exploring by night, combat, etc. Music mods add new tracks to these playlists but due to the way plugins work, when two music mods add tracks to the same playlist, only the plugin that is loaded last will actually work.

The final plugin, **Yet Another Music Merge**, functions both as a all-in-one plugin and as a patch. It is a merge of all the music mods installed before as well as a patch combining their tracks in the playlists. That means you need to install ALL of the music mods listed below AND the music merge OR skip this section altogether.
