## Combat

### [Blade and Blunt - Vanilla Difficulty Modifiers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34549?tab=files)

With Blade and Blunt, the SimonRim combat overhaul, the difficulty is increased noticably. If, like me, you don't necessarily appreciate harder combat situations, you can use this addon to revert the difficulty modifiers to vanilla: You will deal more damage and receive less.

This mod is **optional**.

### [Blade and Blunt - Timed Block Module](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/34549?tab=files)

Timed Blocking is not a feature in Blade and Blunt but has now been added by popular request. The reason is that shield bashing is a far better alternative in terms of balancing: Take a chance and interrupt your foe's power attack with a bash. If you time it just right, you will interrupt them and gain a window of opportunity. If you don't, you will bear the full brunt of their swing. When using Timed Block on the other hand, the worst that can happen is that you mistime your block and instead of getting a timed block only block normally.

Whether that makes combat feel too easy or just satisfying is up to you. This mod is **optional**.

### [Disable Cinematic Kills](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/169?tab=files)

I don't like kill cams. This mod is **optional**.

*In case you're wondering: Kill cams against the player are already disabled by Blade and Blunt. This is because they can be somewhat unfair and trigger even on attacks that normally wouldn't have killed the PC.*

### [Werewolf Killcam Remover](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41925?tab=files)

Because the previous mod doesn't affect werewolves. This mod is **optional**.
