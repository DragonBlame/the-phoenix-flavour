## My Picks

These are various mods that I like but cannot justify adding to base TPF.

### **[Dragonborn Presence - Discord Rich Presence](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25287?tab=files)**

If you are familiar with Discord, you may know the rich presence feature which will add certain current activities to your profile. For instance, with the Spotify integration, you can see what someone is currently listening to. Or you can see the game they are playing. With Dragonborn Presence other people will see not only that you're playing Skyrim but also the name and level of your character as well as where you currently are ingame.

This mod is **optional**.

#### Download Instructions

- **Main Files:** Dragonborn Presence

#### Installation Instructions

- Install the mod as usual through Mod Organizer 2.
- Right-click the **Data** folder and select **Set as data directory**.
- Click **OK** to confirm and install.
- Right-click the mod in your **Downloads** tab and select **Open File**.
- Navigate to your **root** folder: `Steam\steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition`.
- Extract the **discord-rpc.dll** into your **root** folder.

### **[Dragon Claws Auto-Unlock](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/47329?tab=files)**

Simply auto-solves the puzzles. Look, I've done them a hundred times - I don't need to "figure out" the combinations again.

This mod is **optional**.

#### Download Instructions

- **Main Files:** Dragon Claws Auto-Unlock (Simultaneous)

### **[No Lockpicking](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32218?tab=files)**

This one ... may be slightly controversial. It deletes the lockpicking minigame but without ruining balancing as lockpicks will still be consumed depending on lock difficulty.

This mod is **optional**.

#### Download Instructions

- **Main Files:** NoLockPicking v2

### **[All No Tails](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23927?tab=files)**

Ok, so this one is probably *very* controversial. It removes tails from Khajiit and Argonians. Hear me out - what are the tails good for? They look awful, clip through clothing and armor, move weirdly. Cats have tails to help them balance but what do Khajiit with their human-like shape need them for?

This mod is **optional**.

#### Download Instructions

- **Main Files:** All No Tails (PC)

#### Installation Instructions

- Install the mod as usual through Mod Organizer 2.
- Check only the **All no tails** box at the top and click **Ok**.

#### Additional Instructions

- Flag the plugin as ESL in SSEEdit (no compacting required).

## Simple Potions

Have you ever thought that potion bottles don't need to be so fancy? No? Then you can skip this mod. Simple Potions changes the mesh for all potion vials to the same one so they only differ in colour. The textures are by Gamwich (just like RUSTIC POTIONS in base TPF). Simple Potions is **optional** and you can skip this section.

### **[Simple Potions](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/15911?tab=files)**

The main mod.

#### Download Instructions

- **Main Files:** Simple Potions

### **[Simple Potions - Compatibility Patches](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42014?tab=files)**

This mod will cover all conflicts between Simple Potions and other TPF mods (the USSEP as well as Alchemy Food and Potions Adjustments).

#### Download Instructions

- **Main Files:** Simple Potions compatibility patches

#### FOMOD Instructions

- **Patch for:** Alchemy Food and Potions Adjustments (APFA)
