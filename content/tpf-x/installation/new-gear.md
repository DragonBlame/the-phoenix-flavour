## Royal Armory

I've been interested in trying Royal Armory by PrivateEye for a long while but was put off by a few rather significant bugs and varying asset quality. Thankfully, these things have been fixed and improved by modders now.

Royal Armory is **optional**. If you choose to install it, install the other two mods as well.
