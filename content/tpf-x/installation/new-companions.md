## Inigo

Everyone loves Inigo. It hurt my soul when I removed him from base TPF and I only did so after promising myself to bring him back in some way. This is where I will fulfill that promise.

### **[Inigo](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1461?tab=files)**

The smartest blue cat.

#### Download Instructions

- **Main Files:** INIGO_V2.4C SE

### **[Inigo Whistle Key](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29406?tab=files)**

One major gameplay feature of Inigo's is the ability to issue commands by whistling to him. This is something introduced during his quests and will be explained ingame in detail. Normally the Whistle is a regular power but having it on a hotkey is far more useful. I chose the V version because X is the default hotkey for toggling Immersive HUD already.

#### Download Instructions

- **Optional Files:** InigoWhistleKeyV12-KeyV

### **[Mr. Dragonfly ENB Particle Light](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45664?tab=files)**

Inigo wears a Dragonfly in a Jar on his belt which he frequently talks with. All vanilla Bugs in a Jar already have ENB particle lights added to them by a mod in base TPF so it's only fitting that Mr. Dragonfly gets the same treatment.

#### FOMOD Instructions

- **Color Options:** Teal (My preference)

### **[The Phoenix Flavour - Inigo Patch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/14223?tab=files)**

All conflicts with the rest of TPF are covered in this patch as well as a number of personal tweaks and improvements.

## Lucien

Lucien is written and voiced by Joseph Russell and incidentally features a lot of interactions with Inigo as well as a ton of other incredible features and very solid voice-acting.
