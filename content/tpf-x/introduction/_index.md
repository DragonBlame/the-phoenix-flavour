  About TPF-X, a content addon for The Phoenix Flavour.
---

**TPF-X IS NOT CURRENTLY SUPPORTED.**

I am working on standalone, expanded WJ-only version of TPF-X. Until that releases, the TPF-X section here on the site will stay online, but it is unsupported and partially outdated.

## Overview

The Phoenix Flavour Extended or **TPF-X** for short is an **Addon** for the main TPF setup. It requires an up-to-date installation of The Phoenix Flavour and you will need to start a new save game.

TPF-X and other TPF Addons are *separate* from the main guide. This means that you will not receive support in the official guide channels on Discord after installing it. You should install *and test* the main setup first before installing an Addon. You may ask for support in the `#tpf-addons-support` channel.

### Wabbajack

TPF-X may be added as a second profile in the official Wabbajack installer in the future. Until then I strongly recommend against Wabbajack users installing the Addon following the manual instructions as they involve modding procedures that you are expected to have learnt during the manual installation of the main setup.

## Features

TPF-X contains mods I personally want to play with but cannot reasonably add to the main setup. That includes both additional content as well as UI and other tweaks that are too much of a departure from the original style to be considered "vanilla plus". While I have a strict concept that I follow when selecting mods for TPF, I intend to use TPF-X mostly for trying things out.

- **Interface:** Contains some interface mods most of which used to be in the base TPF setup but were removed. I don't actually play with most of these but they are easy additions and painless for me to support. Also contains two alternate font replacers!
- **Gameplay Tweaks:** Additional mods that only affect combat so far, turning down the difficulty to more vanilla-like levels and disabling kill cams altogether which is my personal preference.
- **New Gear:** I have added a long-time personal favourite of mine, Royal Armory by PrivateEye which has been fixed and improved by other mod authors and brought to a state where it will fit in beautifully.
- **New Companions:** I have added Inigo, my beloved blue cat, with a bunch of improvements, as well as Lucien. It is unlikely that I will be adding more companions in the future but these two already bring insane amounts of content to the table.
- **Player Homes:** Currently includes patches for three player homes from the Creation Club: Tundra Homestead, Myrwatch, and Shadowfoot Sanctum. The original "creations" are obviously required.
- **New Music:** My personal favourite new music mods, all merged into a single, patched plugin. Features music by NirShor and OrganicView as well as new tracks from the original composer, Jeremy Soule.
- **Miscellaneous:** A selection of mods I wouldn't add to TPF as they may be slightly controversial (see for yourself).
- **AllGUD:** Support for All Geared Up Derivative which was removed from the main guide.

**TPF-X is modular.** All mods are optional (although if you choose to install a mod, you need to also install all related mods and patches).

## Future Plans

TPF-X is a thing I do for fun while the main TPF setup is my priority. That being said, I have some ideas for TPF-X which includes instructions for overhauling the UI to have a paper look (combining Dear Diary with a few other mods) or integrating more player homes and other content mods.

### Legacy Support

I *may* at *some* point in the future add Legacy of the Dragonborn to TPF-X. I've wanted to try the mod out for a long time and when I do, I want to play it with TPF. I'm rather looking forward to trying the mod out with all its bells and whistles. May even add Wyrmstooth for the occasion. And Curator's Companion.

Now before you get all excited, this is a ways off, I've still got a default TPF playthrough to finish up before I'll get to LOTD. Until then, you can always use Codygit's TPF LOTD integration addon [Flavoured Legacy](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45777).

## Requirements

- An **up-to-date** and **unedited** installation of The Phoenix Flavour.
