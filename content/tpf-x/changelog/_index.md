## Release 1.0

> 06/04/2021

This is the first version of TPF-X that I fully expect to contain issues of some sort. Those may range from typos to imperfect instructions that need refining. **Please consider TPF-X 1.0 a beta version of sorts.** Updates will follow when sufficient feedback was collected.
