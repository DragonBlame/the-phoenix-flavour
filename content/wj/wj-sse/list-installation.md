  How to install Wabbajack and install any list.
---

This is a continuation of the [Game Setup](/wj/wj-sse/game-setup/) page which is a prerequisite. It covers the installation of any support Wabbajack list, provided you have prepared your Skyrim SE installation as outlined on the previous page.

## Wabbajack

Similarly to the vanilla game files, Wabbajack should also not be installed in any UAC protected folders. A top-level folder such as `C:\Wabbajack\` is once again recommended as the installation directory.

- Create a new **Wabbajack** folder.

The Wabbajack app can be downloaded directly from the website:

- Click the **Download** button on the home page of the [Wabbajack](https://www.wabbajack.org/#/) site.
- Move the downloaded **Wabbajack.exe** into the folder you previously created.
- Upon launching it, the latest version of Wabbajack will be downloaded into the same directory.

### Choosing a list

Once Wabbajack has launched, you can click the **Browse Modlists** button to view all currently available lists. If you are following these instructions, you likely already know which mod list you want to install.

- Find your chosen list in the Gallery and click the download button.

> For demonstration purposes, the images are going to show the installation of The Phoenix Flavour.

## List Configuration

Once the meta file for your chosen list has been downloaded, a new browser window with the list's readme will automatically open. You can simply continue here on this page (if your list supports it to begin with).

Before you can begin installing the list, you need to define some file paths:

### Installation Location

The **Installation Location** will be the folder in which Mod Organizer 2 and all mods are installed in.

- It should be **outside** of aforementioned protected folders.
- It should be on the same hard drive as your Skyrim SE installation.
- It should be on your fastest hard drive (ideally an SSD).
- It should be in or near the root of your drive (top-level folder).

For example, with Skyrim SE installed under `G:\Steam Library\steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition`, a good location for the Wabbajack list would be `G:\Modlist Name\`.

### Download Location

The **Download Location** will be the folder in which all downloaded mod archives are stored in. It is a sub-folder of your MO2 directory (Installation Location) by default. However, the downloaded archives are only needed for installing and updating the list, not for playing. Therefore, they do not need to be on the same hard drive as the vanilla game and installed mod files, so the 50GB+ of space they take up would be wasted on an SSD. Any HDD is perfectly sufficient to store these archives.

## Installation

Once you have set target folders for the **Installation Location** and **Download Location**, the **Start** button (arrow) to the right of the folder paths will light up. Click it to start the installation of the list. If you have Nexus Premium, simply lean back and wait for the process to be completed. It may take several hours depending on the speed of your internet connection. If you do not have Premium, Wabbajack will prompt you with the mod pages where you have to click the download button manually.

### Troubleshooting

While Wabbajack runs perfectly fine in most cases, an installation may fail for various reasons. If it does, diagnosing the issue is possible with the logs generated by Wabbajack which you can find within your Wabbajack installation directory in the logs folder: `\Wabbajack\logs\`. The relevant log will be named **Wabbajack.current.log** with older logs being renamed according to the time of their creation.

If Wabbajack fails, please try restarting it first. You will not lose any progress by closing and reopening the app.

If the issue persists, find the Discord support channel for your chosen list (either on the [Wabbajack](https://discord.com/invite/wabbajack) or the list author's server) and drop the **Wabbajack.current.log** with a request for support.

## Game Folder Files

Once Wabbajack has succesfully installed your list, you have one final step to complete. I already mentioned that Mod Organizer 2 only affects the **data** folder, but not the **root** folder. Certain files must be installed in the **root** folder, however, and users need to move them manually.

> Some Wabbajack lists use a method to work around this and will already have moved these files for you. Check the documentation for your list to find out where you need to follow this step or not.

- Navigate to where you installed your list, e.g. `C:\Modlist Name\`.
- You will find a **Game Folder Files** folder inside. Open it.

The contents of this folder must be copied over into your **root** folder: `\Your Steam Library\steamapps\common\Skyrim Special Edition`.

Please note that some lists (such as The Phoenix Flavour) contain *multiple* ENB presets for you to choose from. In that case, move only the loose files from **Game Folder Files** to your **root** folder, then open the folder for the ENB preset you want, and copy its contents into the **root** folder as well.

Alternatively, you can use an ENB manager for any ENB or ReShade presets.

## Launching the Game

Wabbajack lists must always be start with the **Skyrim Script Extender** which in turn must be launched through **Mod Organizer 2**. Remember that your mod list installation directory is simply a Mod Organizer 2 instance.

- Double-click the **ModOrganizer.exe** within your mod list installation directory.

Now you can see the full setup: The mod order is on the left, likely sorted below separators that may be collapsed by default, and the load order with all plugins on the right. Above the load order (in the right pane), you can see the executables drop-down. Very likely the **Skyrim Script Extender** was already selected here, so you can start the game by clicking **RUN**.

> Note that some Wabbajack lists, including The Phoenix Flavour, may change the name and/or icon of the SKSE launcher. If what is selected in the executables drop-down is named after the list you installed, it is probably what you should run to start the game.

**Always run SKSE through MO2 to start the game.** If you launch the game through Steam or directly with the default executables (e.g. SkyrimSE.exe), your mods will not load and the game will simply be vanilla. If you run the default executables through MO2 (instead of the SKSE launcher), many mods will also not work because they require SKSE.

## Final Configurations

Many Skyrim SE mods can be configured ingame through the **Mod Configuration Menu** (MCM) which is part of the interface overhaul [SkyUI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/12604). Wabbajack lists typically have instructions or at least recommendations in their documentations. They may also allow you to enable optional mods or switch to different profiles in Mod Organizer 2.

**Your Wabbajack list is fully installed at this point.** Please return to the list's original readme for any further instructions, MCM suggestions, and gameplay tips.
